## GitHub Workflow

We're following basic GitHub Flow. If you have no idea what we're talking 
about, check out [GitHub's official guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). 
Note that merge is only performed by the repository maintainer.

Guide for performing commits:

* Isolate each commit to one component/bugfix/issue/feature
* Use a standard commit message format:

>     [component/folder touched]: Description intent of your changes
>
>     [List of changes]
>
> 	  Signed-off-by: Your Name your@email.com

For example:

>     swss-common: Stabilize the ConsumerTable
>
>     * Fixing autoreconf
>     * Fixing unit-tests by adding checkers and initialize the DB before start
>     * Adding the ability to select from multiple channels
>     * Health-Monitor - The idea of the patch is that if something went wrong with the notification channel,
>       we will have the option to know about it (Query the LLEN table length).
>
>       Signed-off-by: user@dev.null


* Each developer should fork this repository and [add the team as a Contributor](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
* Push your changes to your private fork and do "pull-request" to this repository
* Use a pull request to do code review
* Use issues to keep track of what is going on

## Expectations for pull requests
Pull requests should be free of any known bugs and be accompanied by tests and appropriate documentation.  Test coverage may include unit tests, integration tests such as [PTF tests](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/wiki/HOWTO-write-a-PTF-Test) defined in the [sonic-mgmt repo](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/tree/master/ansible/roles/test/tasks).

## Commiting new test
When committing a new feature with a new test, please complete a [test plan from the template](doc/SONiC%20Test%20Plan%20Template.md)


## Responding to pull requests
Responsible individual: A contribution needs to be looked at by its 
maintainers. In the absence of the maintainer, the project leader can respond.
A pull request should be responded to in approximately 48 hours. This does 
not mean the contribution will be resolved in 48 hours.  It could even mean 
an email that states: “busy now, will get to it soon.” 

## Contributors License Agreement
All contributors must sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/contributors/individual-contributor) before 
contributions can be accepted. This process is managed by the [Linux Foundation - EasyCLA](https://easycla.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) and automated
via a GitHub bot. If the contributor has not yet signed a CLA, the bot will create a comment on the pull request containing a link to electronically sign the CLA.
