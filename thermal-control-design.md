## 1. Overview

The purpose of Thermal Control is to keep the switch at a proper temperature by using cooling devices, e.g., fan.
Thermal control daemon need to monitor the temperature of devices (CPU, ASIC, optical modules, etc) and the running status of fan. It store temperature values fetched from sensors and thermal device running status to the DB, to make these data available to CLI and SNMP or other apps which interested.

Thermal control also enforce some environment related polices to help the thermal control algorithm to adjust the switch temperature.

## 2. Thermal device monitoring

Thermal monitoring function will retrieve the switch device temperatures via platform APIs, platform APIs not only provide the value of the temperature, but also provide the threshold value. The thermal object status can be deduced by comparing the current temperature value against the threshold. If it above the high threshold or under the low threshold, alarm shall be raised.

Besides device temperature, shall also monitoring the fan running status.

Thermal device monitoring will loop at a certain period, 60s can be a good value since usually temperature don't change much in a short period.

### 2.1 Temperature monitoring 

In new platform API ThermalBase() class provides get_temperature(), get_high_threshold(),  get_low_threshold(), get_critical_high_threshold() and get_critical_low_threshold() functions, values for a thermal object can be fetched from them. Warning status can also be deduced.

For the purpose of feeding CLI/SNMP or telemetry functions, these values and warning status can be stored in the state.  DB schema can be like this:

    ; Defines information for a thermal object
    key                     = TEMPERATURE_INFO|object_name   ; name of the thermal object(CPU, ASIC, optical modules...)
    ; field                 = value
    temperature             = FLOAT                          ; current temperature value
    timestamp               = STRING                         ; timestamp for the temperature fetched
    high_threshold          = FLOAT                          ; temperature high threshold
    critical_high_threshold = FLOAT                          ; temperature critical high threshold
    low_threshold           = FLOAT                          ; temperature low threshold
    critical_low_threshold  = FLOAT                          ; temperature critical low threshold
    warning_status          = BOOLEAN                        ; temperature warning status

These devices shall be included to the temperature monitor list but not limited to: CPU core, CPU pack, ASIC, PSU, Optical Modules, etc.

TEMPERATURE_INFO Table key object_name convention can be "device_name + index"  or device_name if there is no index, like "cpu_core_0", "asic", "psu_2".  Appendix 1 listed all the thermal sensors that supported on Mellanox platform.

### 2.2 Fan device monitoring 

In most case fan is the device to cool down the switch when the temperature is rising. Thus to make sure fan running at a proper speed is the key for thermal control.

Fan target speed and speed tolerance was defined, by examining them we can know whether the fan reached at the desired speed.

same as the temperature info, a [table for fan](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/blob/master/doc/pmon/pmon-enhancement-design.md#153-fan-table) also defined as below:

    ; Defines information for a fan
    key                     = FAN_INFO|fan_name              ; information for the fan
    ; field                 = value
    drawer_name             = STRING                         ; information for the fan drawer
    presence                = BOOLEAN                        ; presence of the fan
    model                   = STRING                         ; model name of the fan
    serial                  = STRING                         ; serial number of the fan
    status                  = BOOLEAN                        ; status of the fan
    direction               = STRING                         ; direction of the fan 
    speed                   = INT                            ; fan speed
    speed_tolerance         = INT                            ; fan speed tolerance
    speed_target            = INT                            ; fan target speed
    led_status              = STRING                         ; fan led status
    timestamp               = STRING                         ; timestamp for the fan info fetched

### 2.3 Syslog for thermal control

If there was warning raised or warning cleared, log shall be generated:

    High temperature warning: PSU 1 current temperature 85C, high threshold 80C！
    High temperature warning cleared, PSU 1 temperature restore to 75C, high threshold 80C

If fan broken or become up present, log shall be generated：

    Fan removed warning: Fan 1 was removed from the system, potential overheat hazard!
    Fan removed warning cleared: Fan 1 was inserted.

## 3. Thermal control management

Adjust cooling device according to the current temperature can be very vendor specific and some vendors already have their own implementation. In below Appendix chapter describes a Mellanox implementation. But handle the cooling device according to some predefined policies can be generic, this is part of what Thermal control management will do.

This cooling device control function can be disabled if the vendor have their own implementation in the kernel or somewhere else.

### 3.1 Thermal control management flow

It will be a routing function to check whether the policies was hit an the fan speed need to adjust, and also run vendor specific thermal control algorithm.

Below policies are examples that can be applied:

- Set PWM to full speed if one of PS units is not present

- Set PWM to full speed if one of FAN drawers is not present or one of tachometers is broken present

- Set the fan speed to a consant value (60% of full speed) thermal control functions was disabled.

FAN status led and PSU status led shall also be set accordingly when policy meet.

Policy check functions will go through the device status and adjust the fan speed if necessary, these check will be preformed by calling the platform new API.

A thermal control daemon class will be deifined with above functions defined, vendors will be allowed to have their own implementation.

### 3.2 Policy management

Policies are defined in a json file for each hwsku, for example, one SKU want to apply below policies:

- Thermal control algorithm control, enabled this hwsku or not, fan speed value to set if not running;

- Thermal information needs to be collected;

- FAN absence action, suspend the algorithm or not, fan speed value to set;

- PSU absence action, suspend the algorithm or not, fan speed value to set;

- All FAN and PSU presence action, suspend the algorithm or not, fan speed value to set.

Below is an example for the policy configuration:

```json
{
    "thermal_control_algorithm": {
        "run_at_boot_up": "true",
        "fan_speed_when_suspend": "60"
    },
    "info_types": [
        {
            "type": "fan_info"
        },
        {
            "type": "psu_info"
        },
        {
            "type": "chassis_info"
        }
    ],
    "policies": [
        {
            "name": "any fan absence",
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "type": "fan.any.absence"
                }
            ],
            "actions": [
                {
                    "type": "thermal_control.control",
                    "status": "false"
                },
                {
                    "type": "fan.all.set_speed",
                    "speed": "100"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "any psu absence",
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "type": "psu.any.absence"
                }
            ],
            "actions": [
                {
                    "type": "thermal_control.control",
                    "status": "false"
                },
                {
                    "type": "fan.all.set_speed",
                    "speed": "100"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "any fan broken",
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "type": "fan.any.fault"
                }
            ],
            "actions": [
                {
                    "type": "thermal_control.control",
                    "status": "false"
                },
                {
                    "type": "fan.all.set_speed",
                    "speed": "100"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "all fan and psu presence",
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "type": "fan.all.presence"
                },
                {
                    "type": "psu.all.presence"
                },
                {
                    "type": "fan.all.good"
                }
            ],
            "actions": [
                {
                    "type": "thermal_control.control",
                    "status": "true"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

In this configuration, thermal control algorithm will run on this device; in fan absence situation, the fan speed need to be set to 100%, the thermal control algorithm will be suspended; in psu absence situation, thermal control algorithm will be suspend, fan speed will be set to 100%; in fan broken situation, the fan speed need to be set to 100%, the thermal control algorithm will be suspended.

During daemon start, this json configuration file will be loaded and parsed, daemon will handle the thermal control algorithm run and fan speed set when predefined policy meet.

### 3.3 Policy implementation

A few Python class will be added to sonic-platform-common to support thermal policy.

- ThermalManagerBase is responsible for initializing thermal algorithm, loading the json configuration file, collecting thermal information and performing thermal policies. ThermalManagerBase is a singleton.
- ThermalPolicy stores thermal conditions and thermal actions. For a ThermalPolicy instance, once all thermal conditions meet, all its thermal actions will be executed.
- ThermalJsonObject provides abstract interface "load_from_json" to allow derived class de-serialize from json configuration file.
- ThermalPolicyInfoBase inherits ThermalJsonObject, provides abstract interface "collect" to allow derived class collect information which will be used by thermal conditions and thermal actions.
- ThermalPolicyConditionBase inherits ThermalJsonObject, provides abstract interface "is_match" to allow vendors define their own thermal conditions.
- ThermalPolicyActionBase inherits ThermalJsonObject, provides abstract interface "execute" to allow vendors trigger their own thermal actions.

#### 3.3.1 Thermal condition implementation

To implement a concrete thermal condition class, vendor need inherit from ThermalPolicyConditionBase and implement the "is_match" and "load_from_json" interfaces. For example:

```python
@thermal_json_object('my.condition.name')
class MyCondition(ThermalPolicyConditionBase):
    def __init__(self):
        self.member1 = None
        self.member2 = None

    def is_match(self, thermal_info_dict):
        # the thermal_info_dict argument is a dictionary of concrete ThermalPolicyInfoBase instances.
        # if bad:
        #     return True
        # else:
        #     return False

    def load_from_json(self, json_obj):
        self.member1 = json_obj['member1']
        self.member2 = json_obj['member1']
```

And the json configuration for MyCondition class is like:

```json
{
    "type": "my.condition.name",
    "member1": "1",
    "member2": "true"
}
```

The decorator "thermal_json_object" will register this new thermal condition type to a type dictionary with name "my.condition.name" so that this class can be de-serialized from json configuration.

#### 3.3.2 Thermal action implementation

To implement a concrete thermal action class, vendor need inherit from ThermalPolicyActionBase and implement the "execute" and "load_from_json" interfaces. For example:

```python
@thermal_json_object('my.action.name')
class MyAction(ThermalPolicyActionBase):
    def __init__(self):
        self.speed = None

    def execute(self, thermal_info_dict):
        # the thermal_info_dict argument is a dictionary of concrete ThermalPolicyInfoBase instances.
        fan_info_obj = thermal_info_dict['fan_info']
        for fan in fan_info_obj.get_presence_fans():
            fan.set_speed(self.speed)

    def load_from_json(self, json_obj):
        self.speed = json_obj['speed']
```

And the json configuration for MyAction class is like:

```json
{
    "type": "my.action.name",
    "speed": "60"
}
```

The decorator "thermal_json_object" will register this new thermal action type to a type dictionary with name "my.action.name" so that this class can be de-serialized from json configuration.

#### 3.3.3 Thermal information implementation

To implement a concrete thermal information class, vendor need inherit from ThermalPolicyInfoBase and implement the "collect" and "load_from_json" interfaces. For example:

```python
@thermal_json_object('my.info.name')
class MyInfo(ThermalPolicyInfoBase):
    def __init__(self):
        self.absence_fan = None
        self.presence_fan = None

    def collect(self, chassis):
        self.absence_fan = []
        self.presence_fan = []
        for fan in chassis.get_all_fans():
            if fan.get_presence():
                self.presence_fan.append(fan)
            else:
                self.absence_fan.append(fan)

    def load_from_json(self, json_obj):
        pass
```

And the json configuration for MyInfo class is like:

```json
{
    "type": "my.info.name"
}
```

The decorator "thermal_json_object" will register this new thermal information type to a type dictionary with name "my.info.name" so that this class can be de-serialized from json configuration.

After defining concrete thermal condition, thermal action and thermal information class, the json configuration can use them like this:

```json
{
    "thermal_control_algorithm": {
        "run_at_boot_up": "false",
        "fan_speed_when_suspend": "60"
    },
    "info_types": [
        {
            "type": "my.info.name"
        }
    ],
    "policies": [
        {
            "name": "my policy",
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "type": "my.condition.name",
                    "member1": "1",
                    "member2": "true"
                }
            ],
            "actions": [
                {
                    "type": "my.action.name",
                    "speed": "60"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Once ThermalManagerBase loads this configuration file, it will de-serialize one MyInfo object, one ThermalPolicy object which contains one MyCondition object and one MyAction object. ThermalManagerBase will call MyInfo.collect every 60 seconds, and detect if MyCondition.is_match returns True, if MyCondition.is_match returns True, MyAction.execute will be called. This allow vendor to take different actions according to different conditions. Vendor can also define thermal information to assist actions and conditions.

## 4. CLI show command for temperature and fan design

### 4.1 New CLI show command for temperature

adding a new sub command to the "show platform":

    admin@sonic# show platform ?
    Usage: show platform [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

      Show platform-specific hardware info

    Options:
      -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

    Commands:

### 4.2 New show CLI for fan status

We don't have a CLI for fan status getting yet, new CLI for fan status could be like below, it's adding a new sub command to the "show platform":

    admin@sonic# show platform ?
    Usage: show platform [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

      Show platform-specific hardware info

    Options:
      -?, -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      fan        Show fan status information
      mlnx       Mellanox platform specific configuration...
      psustatus  Show PSU status information
      summary    Show hardware platform information
      syseeprom  Show system EEPROM information
The output of the command is like below:

    admin@sonic# show platform fan
    Drawer     FAN    Speed      Direction  Presence     Status  LED    Timestamp
    --------   -----  ---------  ---------  -----------  ------  -----  -----------------
    Drawer 1   FAN 1  85%        intake     Present      OK      green  20191112 09:38:16
    Drawer 1   FAN 2  60%        intake     Present      OK      green  20191112 09:38:16
    Drawer 2   FAN 3  75%        exhaust    Present      Not OK  red    20191112 09:38:16
    Drawer 2   FAN 4  65%        exhaust    Present      Not OK  red    20191112 09:38:16

The output for virtual drawer is like below:

    admin@sonic# show platform fan
    Drawer     FAN    Speed      Direction  Presence     Status  LED    Timestamp
    --------   -----  ---------  ---------  -----------  ------  -----  -----------------
    N/A        FAN 1  85%        intake     Present      OK      green  20191112 09:38:16
    N/A        FAN 2  60%        intake     Present      OK      green  20191112 09:38:16
    N/A        FAN 3  75%        exhaust    Present      Not OK  red    20191112 09:38:16
    N/A        FAN 4  65%        exhaust    Present      Not OK  red    20191112 09:38:16 

## 5. Fan drawer implementation

In many hardware platform, multiple fans are put in a fan drawer. We suggest to add a fan drawer object to reflect real hardware layout. It will help user better understand which fan are in which drawer. A new abstract class FanDrawerBase is added to sonic_platform_common and vendors should implement it. The FanDrawerBase class will look like:

```python

class FanDrawerBase(device_base.DeviceBase):
    def get_num_fans(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def get_all_fans(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def set_status_led(self, color):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def get_status_led(self):
        raise NotImplementedError
```

The fan drawer object should follow:

- If there are fans without drawer, we still add a virtual drawer object for each of fan, and consider the drawer only has one fan. thermalctld always loop fan drawer first, that's why we need virtual drawer. We don't show virtual drawer in CLI.
- Add two new member functions "get_num_fan_drawers" and "get_all_fan_drawers" to ChassisBase, vendor need to implement these two new functions to properly initialize chassis object with fan drawer objects.

## 6. FAN led management

In current implementation, fan led management API is based on fan object. However, when there is a fan drawer, fans in the same drawer may share one fan led. In such case, to control fan led in a fan object might cause problem. For example, one fan drawer has fan1 and fan2, they share a fan led, fan1 is broken and set led to red via fan1 object, then fan2 just recovers from a bad state and set led to green via fan2 object, the final fan led state will be green which is incorrect.

If multiple fans share a led in a drawer, drawer need to have internal logic to judge led color according to all its fan status, this is upon vendor’s implementation. For example, if one drawer has two fans, one is in bad state, the fan led color should be red. In the situation when need to set led, thermal control daemon will call fan led set API as well as it’s drawer’s led set api, vendor’s led implementation need to make sure there is no conflict or overwrite case.

Consider following scenario:

1. FAN speed is below target speed than threshold. In this case, set FAN led to red and alert a warning message "Fan low speed warning: <fan_name> current speed=<current_speed>, target speed=<target_speed>, tolerance=<tolerance_value>.". If the FAN speed back to normal, set FAN led to green and notice a message "FAN low speed warning cleared: <fan_name> speed is back to normal".
2. FAN speed is faster than target speed than threshold. In this case, set FAN led to red and alert a warning message "Fan high speed warning: <fan_name> current speed=<current_speed>, target speed=<target_speed>, tolerance=<tolerance_value>.". If the FAN speed back to normal, set FAN led to green and notice a message "FAN high speed warning cleared: <fan_name> speed is back to normal".
3. FAN is removed from switch. In this case, set FAN led to red and alert a warning message "Fan removed warning: <fan_name> was removed from the system, potential overheat hazard!". If the FAN is inserted back, set FAN led to green and notice a message "Fan removed warning cleared: Fan 1 was removed from the system, potential overheat hazard!".
4. Insufficient number of working fans in the system. In this case, alert a warning message "Insufficient number of working FANs warning: <absence_fan_number> FANs are not present." If all FANs are present, notice a message "Insufficient number of working FANs warning cleared: all FANs are present".
5. Any FAN is broken. In this case, set FAN led to red and alert a warning message "FAN fault warning: <fan_name> is broken.". If the FAN is back to normal, set FAN led to green and notice a message "FAN fault warning cleared: <fan_name> is back to normal".

## 7. Potential ehhancement for Platform API

1. Why can't we propose different change events for different cpu/fan/optics?
2. Verbose on API definition on threshold levels about Average/Max/Snapshot.

## 2.Mellanox thermal control implementation

### 2.1 Mellanox thermal Control framework

Mellanox thermal monitoring measure temperature from the ports and ASIC core. It operates in kernel space and binds PWM(Pulse-Width Modulation) control with Linux thermal zone for each measurement device (ports & core). The thermal algorithm uses step_wise policy which set FANs according to the thermal trends (high temperature = faster fan; lower temperature = slower fan).

More detail information can refer to Kernel documents https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/thermal/sysfs-api.txt
and Mellanox HW-management package documents: https://github.com/Mellanox/hw-mgmt/tree/master/Documentation

### 2.2 Components

- The cooling device is an actual functional unit for cooling down the thermal zone: Fan.

- Thermal instance describes how cooling devices work at certain trip point in the thermal zone.

- Governor handles the thermal instance not thermal devices. Step_wise governor sets cooling state based on thermal trend (STABLE, RAISING, DROPPING, RASING_FULL, DROPPING_FULL). It allows only one step change for increasing or decreasing at decision time. Framework to register thermal zone and cooling devices:

- Thermal zone devices and cooling devices will work after proper binding. Performs a routing function of generic cooling devices to generic thermal zones with the help of very simple thermal management logic.

### 2.3 Algorithm

Use step_wise policy for each thermal zone. Set the fan speed according to different trip points. 

### 2.4 Trip points

a series of trip point is defined to trigger fan speed manipulate.

 |state   |Temperature value(Celsius) |PWM speed                  |Action                                    |
 |:------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------|
 |Cold    |      t < 75 C    | 20%        |   Do nothing                             |
 |Normal  |    75 <= t < 85  | 20% - 40%  |   keep minimal speed|
 |High    |  85 <= t < 105   | 40% - 100% | adjust the fan speed according to the trends|
 |Hot     |  105 <= t < 110  | 100%       | produce warning message                     |
 |Critical|  t >= 110        | 100%       |  shutdown |
