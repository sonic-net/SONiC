# About this Manual
This is a high-level design document describing the need to have determinstic approach on SFF compliant modules for Interface link bring-up sequence and workflows for use-cases around it

Parent HLD [Interface-Link-bring-up-sequence.md](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/sfp-cmis/Interface-Link-bring-up-sequence.md) focuses on generic high level background/idea and details for CMIS modules, while this HLD focuses on SFF modules with details.

# Problem Definition
According to parent [HLD](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/sfp-cmis/Interface-Link-bring-up-sequence.md#plan), as already discussed with sonic-chassis workgroup and OCP community:

1.	Presently in SONiC, for SFF compliant modules (100G/40G), there is no synchronization between enabling Tx of optical module and enabling ASIC (NPU/PHY) Tx which may cause link instability during administrative interface enable “config interface startup Ethernet” configuration and bootup scenarios.

2.  During administrative interface disable “config interface shutdown Ethernet”, only the ASIC(NPU) Tx is disabled and not the optical module Tx/laser.
      This will lead to power wastage, un-necessary fan power consumption to keep the module temperature in operating range, and potential lab hazard when the port is shut off but the laser is still on.

# Background

  Refer to parent [HLD](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/sfp-cmis/Interface-Link-bring-up-sequence.md#background)

# Objective

According to parent [HLD](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/sfp-cmis/Interface-Link-bring-up-sequence.md#objective), have a determistic approach for Interface link bring-up sequence for SFF compliant modules (100G/40G) i.e. below sequence to be followed:
  1. Initialize and enable NPU Tx and Rx path
  2. For system with 'External' PHY: Initialize and enable PHY Tx and Rx on both line and host sides; ensure host side link is up
  3. Then perform optics Tx enable

# Plan

Plan is to follow this high-level work-flow sequence to accomplish the Objective:
- Add a new thread SFF task manager (called sff_mgr) inside xcvrd to subscribe to existing field “host_tx_ready” in port table state-DB
- “host_tx_ready” is set to true only when admin_status is up and setting admin_status to syncd/gbsyncd is successful. (As part of setting admin_status to syncd/gbsyncd successfully, the NPU/PHY Tx is enabled/disabled)
- sff_mgr processes the “host_tx_ready” value change event and do optics Tx enable/disable using tx_disable API

# Breakout Handling

Refer to parent [HLD](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/sfp-cmis/Interface-Link-bring-up-sequence.md#breakout-handling)

# Feature enablement

  This feature (optics Interface Link bring-up sequence) would be enabled on per platform basis.
  There could be cases where vendor(s)/platform(s) may take time to shift from existing codebase to the model (work-flows) described in this document.
- By default, sff_mgr feature is disabled.
- In order to enable sff_mgr feature, the platform would set ‘enable_xcvrd_sff_mgr’ to ‘true’ in their respective pmon_daemon_control.json. Xcvrd would parse ‘enable_xcvrd_sff_mgr’ and if found 'true', it would launch SFF task manager (sff_mgr).

# Pre-requisite

In addition to parent HLD's [pre-requisite](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/sfp-cmis/Interface-Link-bring-up-sequence.md#pre-requisite),

> **_Pre-requisite for enabling sff_mgr:_**
Platform needs to leave the transceiver (if capable of disabling Tx) in Tx disabled state when an module inserted or during boot-up. This is to make sure the transceiver is not transmitting with Tx enabled before host_tx_ready is True.

# Proposed Work-Flows

  - ### Flow of pre-requisite for platform in insertion/bootup cases
  ```mermaid
  graph TD;
  A[platfrom brings module out of RESET]
  B[platform keeps module in Tx disabled state immediately after module out-of-RESET]
  C[xcvrd detects module insertion via platform API get_transceiver_change_event, and update module status/info to DB]
  D[Upon module insertion event, sff_mgr takes action accordingly if needed]

  Start --> A
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
  D --> End
  ```
  - ### Feature enablment flow -- how xcvrd spawns sff_mgr thread based on enable_sff_mgr flag
  ```mermaid
  graph TD;
  A[wait for PortConfigDone]
  B[check if enable_sff_mgr flag exists and is set to true]
  C[spawn sff_mgr]
  D[proceed to other thread spawning and tasks]

  Start --> A
  A --> B
  B -- true --> C
  C --> D
  B -- false --> D
  D --> End
  ```
  - ### Flow of calculating target tx_disable value:
      - When ```tx_disable value/status``` is ```True```, it means Tx is disabed
      - when ```tx_disable value/status``` is ```False```, it means Tx is enabled
  ```mermaid
  graph TD;

  A[check if both host_tx_ready is True AND admin_status is UP]
  B[target tx_disable value is set to False, Tx should be turned ON]
  C[target tx_disable value is set to True, Tx should be turned OFF]

  Start --> A
  A -- true --> B
  A -- false --> C
  B --> End
  C --> End
  ```
  - ### Main flow of sff_mgr, covering below cases:
      - system bootup
      - transceiver insertion
      - admin enable/disable configurations
  ```mermaid
  graph TD;
  A[subscribe to events]
  B[while task_stopping_event is not set]
  C[check insertion event, host_tx_ready change event and admin_status change event for each intended port]
  D[double check if module is present]
  E[fetch DB and update host_tx_ready value in local cahce, if not available locally]
  E2[fetch DB and update admin_status value in local cahce, if not available locally]
  F[calculate target tx_disable value based on host_tx_ready and admin_status]
  G[check if tx_disable status on module is already the target value]
  H[go ahead to enable/disable Tx based on the target tx_disable value]

  Start --> A
  A --> B
  B -- true --> C
  C -- if either event happened --> E
  C -- if neither event happened --> B
  E --> E2
  E2 --> D
  D -- true --> F
  D -- false --> B
  F --> G
  G -- true --> B
  G -- false --> H
  H --> B
  B -- false --> End
  ```
