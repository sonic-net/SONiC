## About This Manual ##

This document is intend to provide general information about the Transceiver and Sensor Monitoring implementation.
The requirement is described in [Sensor and Transceiver Info Monitoring Requirement.](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/blob/master/doc/xrcvd/OIDsforSensorandTransciver.MD)

## 1. Xcvrd design ##

New Xcvrd in platform monitor container is designed to fetch the transceiver and DOM sensor information from the eeprom and then update the state db with these info.

For the transceiver it's self, the type, serial number, hardware version, etc. will not change after plug in. The suitable way for transceiver information update can be triggered by transceiver plug in/out event.

The transceiver dom sensor information(temperature, power,voltage, etc.) can change frequently, these information need to be updated periodically, for now the time period temporarily set to 60s(see open question 1), this time period need to be adjusted according the later on test on all vendors platform.

If there is transceiver plug in or plug out, Xcvrd will respond to the change event, write the new transceiver EEPROM into to state DB, or remove the staled info from the STATE_DB.

Transceiver error event will also be handled when it raised to Xcvrd, currently if transceiver on a error status which blocking EEPROM access, Xcvrd will stop updating and remove the transceiver DOM info from DB until it recovered from the error, in this period transceiver static info will be kept.  

### 1.1 State DB Schema ###

New Transceiver info table and transceiver DOM sensor table will be added to state DB to store the transceiver and DOM sensor information. Transceiver status table will store the SFP status, plug in, plug out or in error status.

#### 1.1.3 Transceiver Status Table ####

        ; Defines Transceiver Status info for a port
        key                          = TRANSCEIVER_STATUS|ifname     ; Error information for SFP on port
        ; field                      = value
        status                       = 1*255VCHAR                    ; code of the SFP status (plug in, plug out)
        error                        = 1*255VCHAR                    ; SFP error (N/A or a string consisting of error descriptions joined by "|", like "error1 | error2" )

### 1.2 Accessing EEPROM from platform container ###

Transceiver EEPROM information can be accessed via reading sysfs files(e.g. `/sys/bus/i2c/devices/2-0048/hwmon/hwmon4/qsfp9_eeprom`) or other ways, this is upon vendor's own implementation.

### 1.3 Transceiver change event and vendor platform API ###

#### 1.3.1 Transceiver change event ####

Currently 7 transceiver events are defined as below.

    status='0' SFP removed,
    status='1' SFP inserted,
    status='2' I2C bus stuck,
    status='3' Bad eeprom,
    status='4' Unsupported cable,
    status='5' High Temperature,
    status='6' Bad cable.

However, multiple errors could exist at the same time. For example, a module can be unsupported cable and high temperature. The new transceiver event will be described in a bitmap as below:

    bit 32  : 0=SFP removed, 1=SFP inserted,
    bit 31  : 0=OK, 1=An error that blocks eeprom from being read,
    bit 30  : 0=OK, 1=I2C bus stuck,
    bit 29  : 0=OK, 1=Bad eeprom,
    bit 28  : 0=OK, 1=Unsupported cable,
    bit 27  : 0=OK, 1=High Temperature,
    bit 26  : 0=OK, 1=Bad cable.
    bit 17~25: reserved. Must be 0.
    bit 1~16: vendor specific errors.

    Define bit 32 as the least significant bit and bit 1 as the most significant bit.

The bit 32 represents whether the SFP module is inserted. Any error bit must be set along with this bit.

The bit 31 represents whether the error indicated by platform API will block the SFP module from being read or not. This bit must be set along with other error bits.

Vendor can extend this bitmap with more errors. However, some errors can be vendor specific, which means they won't occur on other vendors' platforms. The bitmap can grow rapidly and eventually run out of bits if all vendors insert vendor specific error codes to the bitmap.

This can be resolved by dividing the bitmap into two parts: one for generic errors and the other for vendor specific errors. The bits 17 ~ 30 represent the generic errors and bits 1 ~ 16 represent the vendor specific errors.

Xcvrd should parse the bitmap and set transceiver status table in database accordingly. The error descriptions is fetched in the following ways:

- For generic errors, they will be translated from error bits by looking up a pre-defined dictionary as xcvrd has the necessary knowledge.
- For vendor specific errors:
  - If the platform API `get_change_event` returns a dict called `sfp_error`, the content of the dict will be taken as the error descriptions.
  - Otherwise, the newly introduced platform API `get_error_description` will be called to fetch the descriptions.
  - For both case, the error descriptions should reflect the vendor specific errors only. If there are multiple errors, the error descriptions should be joined by "|".

For example, if the transceiver event bit map is 0x0F, the status field value should be "1" and the error field value should be "I2C bus stuck|Bad eeprom|Blocking error", indicating the SFP module is inserted with errors `I2C bus stuck` and `Bad eeprom` detected and at least one of the errors is blocking.

#### 1.3.2 API to get Transceiver change event from platform ####

Xcvrd need to be triggered by transceiver change event to refresh the transceiver info table.

How to get this event varies between different platforms. There is no common implementation available.

##### 1.3.2.2 Transceiver change event API in new platform API #####

In new platform API, similar change event API has also been defined and will be extended by adding `sfp_error` key. In case there is an error occurred, the platform API should reflect the error in the `sfp` key and can provide the error descriptions in `sfp_error` key.

The API is defined as below:

    def get_change_event(self, timeout=0):
        """
        Returns a nested dictionary containing all devices which have
        experienced a change at chassis level

        Args:
            timeout: Timeout in milliseconds (optional). If timeout == 0,
                this method will block until a change is detected.

        Returns:
            (bool, dict):
                - True if call successful, False if not;
                - A nested dictionary where key is a device type,
                  value is a dictionary with key:value pairs in the format of
                  {'device_id':'device_event'}, 
                  where device_id is the device ID for this device and
                        device_event,
                             status='1' represents device inserted,
                             status='0' represents device removed.
                  Ex1. {'fan':{'0':'0', '2':'1'}, 'sfp':{'11':'0'}}
                       indicates that fan 0 has been removed, fan 2
                       has been inserted and sfp 11 has been removed.
                  Ex2. {'sfp':{'11':'65537'}, 'sfp_error':{'11':<vendor specific error>}}
                      indicates SFP 11 has been inserted with a vendor specific error represented by bit 16.

##### 1.3.2.3 Xcvrd wrapper for calling transceiver change event API #####

Xcvrd uses a wrapper to call one of the above two APIs depends on the implementation status on a specific platform  to wait for the sfp plug in/out event, following example code showing how these APIs will be called:

    def _wrapper_get_transceiver_change_event(timeout):
        if platform_chassis is not None:
            try:
                status, events =  platform_chassis.get_change_event(timeout)
                sfp_events = events.get('sfp')
                sfp_errors = events.get('sfp_error')
                return status, sfp_events, sfp_errors
            except NotImplementedError:
                pass
        status, sfp_events = platform_sfputil.get_transceiver_change_event(timeout)
        return status, sfp_events, None

It's possible that when received the plug in/out event, the transceiver eeprom is not ready for reading, so need to give another try if first reading failed.

#### 1.3.2 API to get error description of an SFP module ####

##### 1.3.2.1 Platform API definition #####

A new platform API in class SFP is required for fetching the error status of the SFP module.

    def get_error_status(self)
        """
        Get error status of the SFP module
        Returns:
            string: represent the error
        """

##### 1.3.2.2 xcvrd wrapper #####

    def _wrapper_get_sfp_error_description(physical_port):
        if platform_chassis:
            try:
                return platform_chassis.get_sfp(physical_port).get_error_description()
            except NotImplementedError:
                pass
        return None

#### 1.3.3 Transceiver plug in/out and error event implementation on Mellanox platform ####

On Mellanox platform the SFP events is exposed by mlnx SDK, the API will open a channel and listening to the SDK for the events.

During the API init phase(waiting for the channel with SDK created), if Xcvrd called this API and it will return SYSTEM_NOT_READY event.

If SDK failed due to some reason and channel closed, API will raised error(SYSTEM_FAIL) to Xcvrd.

### 1.4 Xcvrd daemon flow ###

Xcvrd will spawn a new process(sfp_state_update_task) to wait for the SFP plug in/out event, when event received, it will update the DB entries accordingly.

A thread will be started to periodically refresh the DOM sensor information.

In the main loop of the Xcvrd task, it periodically check the integrity the DB, if some SFP info missing, will be added back.

Detailed flow as showed in below chart:

![](https://github.com/keboliu/SONiC/blob/master/images/xcvrd-flow.svg)

#### 1.4.1 State machine of sfp\_state\_update\_task process ####

In the process of handling SFP change event, a state machine is defined to handle events(including SFP change events) reported from platform level.

        states definition
          - Initial state: INIT, before receive system ready or a normal event
          - Final state: EXIT
          - Other state: NORMAL, after received system-ready or a normal event
        
        events definition
          - SYSTEM_NOT_READY
          - SYSTEM_BECOME_READY
          - NORMAL_EVENT
            - sfp insertion/removal event
            - sfp error event
            - timeout returned by sfputil.get_change_event with status = true
          - SYSTEM_FAIL

        state transition
          State           event               next state
          INIT            SYSTEM NOT READY    INIT / EXIT
          INIT            SYSTEM FAIL         INIT / EXIT
          INIT            SYSTEM BECOME READY NORMAL
          NORMAL          SYSTEM BECOME READY NORMAL
          NORMAL          SYSTEM FAIL         INIT
          INIT/NORMAL     NORMAL EVENT        NORMAL
          NORMAL          SYSTEM NOT READY    INIT
          EXIT            -

![](https://github.com/keboliu/SONiC/blob/master/images/xcvrd_state_mahine.svg)

#### 1.4.2 Transceiver error events handling procedure ####

When error events (defined in section 1.3.1) are received from a transceiver, the related interface's TRANSCEIVER_STATUS table will be updated with the error descriptions, and the DOM information will be removed from the database.

The DOM update thread will check the transceiver status table before updating the DOM information. The DOM info updating will be skipped for a port if there is a blocking error for the port in the table. The xcvrd main task will also perform the same check-and-skip logic before recovering the missing DOM information for a port.

Currently no explicit "error clear event" is defined, a plug in event will be considered as port recovered from error(on Mellanox platform it does send out a plug in event when recovered from error).

An explicit "error clear event" can be added if some vendor's platform supports this kind of event.

On transceiver plug in or plug out events, the port error status will be cleared.

## 2. SNMP Agent Change ##

### 2.1 MIB tables extension ###

MIB table entPhysicalTable from [Entity MIB(RFC2737)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2737) need to be extended to support new OIDs.

| OID | SNMP counter | Where to get the info in Sonic. | Example: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1 | entPhysicalTable |   |   |

## 3. CLI change ##

### 3.1 Add a command to fetch the error status ###

#### 3.1.1 sfputil extension ####

The utility `sfputil` needs to be updated to extend to support fetching error status of SFP modules.
The CLI is like this:

    sfputil show error-status --fetch-from-hardware --port <port>

The error status can be fetched for

- A specific SFP module designated by --port argument
- or all SPF modules if --port isn't provided

By default, it will fetch the error status from `TRANSCEIVER_STATUS` in `STATE_DB`. It also supports fetching error status from low level component directly. In this case, it will call platform API `get_error_description` from the `pmon` docker.

The error status of each SPF module should be:

- `unplugged` if the module isn't plugged-in
- `OK` if the module is plugged in without any error
- Errors stored in `STATE_DB` or fetched from platform API.

The output of the command is like this:

    admin@sonic:~# sfputil show error-status --port Ethernet8
    Port       Error Status
    ---------  ------------------------------------
    Ethernet8  OK

    admin@sonic:~# sfputil show error-status
    Port         Error Status

#### 3.1.2 show interface transceiver wrapper ####

A wrapper command `show interface transceiver error-status` is also provided.

    show interface transceiver error-status --fetch-from-hardware <port>

The output is the same as that of `sfputil`.
