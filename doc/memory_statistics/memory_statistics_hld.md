## Overview

This High-Level Design (HLD) document explains the Memory Statistics feature in SONiC. The aim is to improve memory monitoring and management to optimize network performance and reliability.

## Introduction

This HLD document introduces the Memory Statistics feature in SONiC, enhancing its native memory monitoring capabilities. Effective memory management is crucial for network performance and stability. Previously, administrators relied on third-party tools, increasing OPEX and operational burdens. The Memory Statistics feature integrates comprehensive memory monitoring into SONiC, providing historical data through the CLI. Key benefits include:

- **Streamlined Troubleshooting:** Facilitates rapid identification of memory usage anomalies that could indicate potential resource bottlenecks or memory irregularities.
- **Detailed Memory Analysis:** Offers in-depth insights into memory usage patterns, allowing administrators to optimize resource allocation and usage effectively.
- **Proactive Maintenance:** Enhances the ability to detect and address memory-related issues quickly, ensuring reliable system performance.

## Proposed Behavior and Design

This section explains how Memory Statistics feature works, focusing on user control and straightforward interaction.

### Feature Overview

- **Feature Scope:** Memory Statistics feature offers a systematic approach to monitoring system-wide memory usage. It automatically records crucial metrics such as Total Memory, Used Memory, Free Memory, Available Memory, Cached Memory, Shared Memory and Buffers. 
- **Configurability:**  This feature offers customizable options for data collection frequency and the duration of data retention according to their specific operational needs. By default, the system is configured to collect memory at all times and sample it every 5 minutes and retains this information for 15 days , ensuring a balance between granularity and storage management.
- **Enable/Disable Functionality:** This feature is disabled by default to conserve system resources , suiting various administrative preferences but can be easily enabled to ensure continuous monitoring.


### Feature Specification

#### Data Collection and Storage

Memory Statistics utilizes a dedicated daemon process for the continuous collection of memory data. This process operates in the background, ensuring minimal impact on system performance. Data is stored in compressed log files within the system, optimizing storage usage while ensuring data is easily retrievable for analysis and reporting.

#### User Interaction

User interaction with the Memory Statistics feature is designed to be straightforward and efficient, utilizing a set of powerful CLI commands that enable administrators to manage and analyze memory data effectively.The CLI interface includes commands for:

- **Viewing Memory Statistics:** Users can view memory data over custom time intervals with `--from` and `--to` options for defining the start and end times. This allows for flexible and targeted data analysis.
  - **Default Memory Overview:** For a quick general overview without specific parameters, the default command displays system memory statistics covering the last 15 days. This will provide a summary of crucial metrics such as Total Memory, Used Memory, Free Memory, Available Memory, Cached Memory, Shared Memory and Buffers, ideal for routine checks.
- **Selecting Specific Memory Metrics:** This feature enables users to choose specific memory metrics to display, such as Total Memory or Free Memory, which helps in focusing on relevant data points and reducing output clutter.
- **Configuring Data Collection and Retention:** Administrators can adjust the frequency of data collection and the duration of data retention through commands and can specify how long to retain the collected data for.
- **Enabling/Disabling the Feature:** To adapt to different operational requirements, users can enable or disable the Memory Statistics feature as needed.
	
### Functional Requirements

- Support for Python psutils package to collect system memory data
- Support for CLI commands for displaying memory information

### Architecture Design

The overall SONiC architecture will remain the same. However, the following updates and additions will be implemented:

- **Daemon Process:**
	- **memorystatsd:** A new system daemon process that will be implemented to gather and log memory statistics.
	- **hostcfgd:** The existing host config daemon will monitor changes in the ConfigDB's `MEMORY_STATISTICS` table and will reload the `memorystatsd` service to apply the new settings.

- **Log File Directories:** Supporting log file directories will be established via SONiC Buildimage.
- **SONiC Utilities Updates:** Changes will be made in the SONiC Utilities container to add new "show" and "config" commands.
- **New Configuration Table:** A new table, MEMORY_STATISTICS, will be added to ConfigDB to store memory-stats configuration parameters.
The high-level feature design diagram is shown below.

## Configuration and Management

### **Daemon Configuration Management**


The `memorystatsd` process will dynamically manage its configuration with the help of `hostcfgd`. The design ensures reliable behavior by utilizing both a predefined configuration file and the ConfigDB for real-time updates.

- **Read Configuration at Startup**: Upon startup, the `memorystatsd` process reads its default configuration from a predefined config file. This guarantees that in the event of a restartâwhether due to a crash or manual interventionâthe daemon will always return to a known, consistent state.

- **Monitor ConfigDB for Changes**: During runtime, `hostcfgd` monitors the `MEMORY_STATISTICS` table in ConfigDB for any configuration changes made via the CLI, such as adjustments to retention periods, sampling intervals, or enabling/disabling the daemon.

- **Signal Daemon to Reload Configuration**: When a configuration change is detected in ConfigDB, `hostcfgd` signals the `memorystatsd` process using the `SIGHUP` signal to reload its configuration without restarting the process. This ensures the changes are applied dynamically during runtime.

- **Graceful Shutdown with SIGTERM**: The `memorystatsd` process is designed to handle the `SIGTERM` signal for a graceful shutdown, allowing it to safely terminate and clean up resources. This ensures any related processes or files are properly handled before the daemon stops.

- **Revert to Default on Restart**: While the daemon can reload configuration from ConfigDB during runtime, upon any restart (whether triggered by a crash or other factors), it will always revert to the default settings defined in the configuration file. This separation between startup defaults and runtime updates ensures predictable and safe behavior in the event of a failure.

- **Default Disabled State**: By default, the `memorystatsd` process will be **disabled**. The user must manually enable it using the CLI before it starts collecting memory statistics. This provides control over when the daemon begins its operations.

### **Workflow for Configuration Management**:

1. **Initial Setup**: Default settings, including retention periods and sampling intervals, are written to the config file during deployment. Optionally, these settings may also be written to ConfigDB.
   
2. **Daemon Startup**: On startup, `memorystatsd` reads its configuration from the predefined config file, initializing the necessary parameters such as retention period and sampling interval. However, it will start in a **disabled state** by default, requiring manual activation.

3. **Enable Daemon Manually**: Administrators need to manually enable the `memorystatsd` process via the CLI before it starts collecting memory statistics.

4. **Runtime Configuration Changes**: Administrators can modify settings like retention periods or sampling intervals via the CLI. These changes are written directly to the `MEMORY_STATISTICS` in ConfigDB.

5. **Monitor ConfigDB for Changes**: `hostcfgd` continuously monitors ConfigDB for updates to the `MEMORY_STATISTICS`.

6. **Signal Daemon to Reload Configuration**: Upon detecting changes in ConfigDB, `hostcfgd` sends a `SIGHUP` signal to the `memorystatsd` daemon, prompting it to reload its configuration without restarting.

7. **Reload Daemon**: The `memorystatsd` process applies the new settings from ConfigDB dynamically, allowing the daemon to continue operating with updated parameters during runtime.

8. **Handling Crashes and Restarts**: In case of a crash or restart, the `memorystatsd` daemon will always reload its default settings from the config file, ensuring a consistent startup state. Runtime-configured values from ConfigDB are only applied during runtime and not retained after a restart unless manually reloaded.

9. **Graceful Shutdown**: When the daemon needs to be stopped, the `SIGTERM` signal ensures a graceful shutdown, where the daemon cleans up resources and terminates smoothly.

### Config DB Enhancements

A new table, `MEMORY_STATISTICS`, will be introduced in `ConfigDB` to store the configuration settings of the Memory Statistics feature. This table will allow for management of data collection frequency, retention period, and enable/disable status. The relevant configuration parameters and the schema for this table are detailed below.

**MEMORY_STATISTICS Configuration Parameters**
