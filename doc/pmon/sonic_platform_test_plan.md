2.5 Check SFP presence
# Introduction

This test plan is to check the functionalities of platform related software components. These software components are for managing platform hardware, including FANs, thermal sensors, SFP, transceivers, pmon, etc.

The software components for managing platform hardware on Mellanox platform is the [hw-management package](https://github.com/Mellanox/hw-mgmt).

To verify that the hw-management package works as expected, the test cases need to be executed on all supported platforms:

* Mellanox ACS-MSN2010
* Mellanox ACS-MSN2100
* Mellanox ACS-MSN2410
* Mellanox ACS-MSN2700
* Mellanox ACS-MSN2740
* Mellanox ACS-MSN3700

The test cases are groupd in two categories:
* Common test cases for all vendors.
* Test cases specific for Mellanox platforms.

In common test cases, some steps are platform dependent. Detailed information will be given in the test cases.

# Common Test Cases

## 1.1 Check platform API implementation

A test suite will install an HTTP server in the PMon container of the DuT. This HTTP server will convert URLs into platform API calls, returning the results of the API call in the HTTP response. All platform API methods will be exercised in this manner, ensuring that:

1. The vendor has implmented the method for the particular platform
2. The API call returned 'sane' data (type is correct, etc.)
3. Where applicable, the data returned is appropriate for the platform being tested (number of fans, number of transceivers, etc.)
4. Where applicable, the data returned is appropriate for the specific DuT (serial number, system EERPOM data, etc.)

## 1.2 Check Platform-Related CLI

This set of tests will verify expected output from all platform-related SONiC CLI commands. The test files will reside in the sonic-mgmt repo under the `tests/platform_tests/cli/` directory.

### Steps

#### Test all subcommands of `show platform`

* Run `show platform summary`
* Turn off/on PSU from PDU (Power Distribution Unit), run `show platform psustatus` respectively. In automation, PDU with programmable interface is required for turning off/on PSU. Without PDU, manual intervention required for this step.

### Pass/Fail Criteria

* `show platform summary` should output these fields: Platform, HwSKU, ASIC, for example:
```
admin@mtbc-sonic-03-2700:~$ show platform summary
Platform: x86_64-mlnx_msn2700-r0
HwSKU: ACS-MSN2700
ASIC: mellanox
```
* PSU status should be `OK` when it is on, `NOT OK` when it is off. Use PDU to turn off/on PSU to verify that correct PSU status can be displayed.
```
admin@mtbc-sonic-03-2700:~$ show platform psustatus
PSU    Status
-----  --------
PSU 1  NOT OK
PSU 2  OK
```
### Automation
New automation required.
The step for turning on/off PSU needs programmable PDU. Need to implement a fixture for turning on/off PSU. When programmable PDU is not available in testbed, this step can only be tested manually. The fixture should be able to return information about whether this capability is supported. If not supported, skip this step in automation.


* Run `show platform syseeprom`
* Use the platform specific eeprom.py utility to directly decode eeprom information from hardware, compare the result with output of cmd `show platform syseeprom`. **This step is platform dependent.** Different eeprom.py utility should be used on different platforms. The below example is taken from Mellanox platform.

* Verify that CPU and memory usage are at the same level before and after the manual intervention.

### Automation
Manual intervention required, not automatable

## 1.14 Check platform daemon status

This test case will check the all daemon running status inside pmon(ledd no included) if they are supposed to to be running on this platform.
* Using command `docker exec pmon supervisorctl status | grep {daemon}` to get the status of the daemon

Expected results of checking daemon status:
* the status of the daemon should be `RUNNING`

### Steps
* Get the running daemon list from the configuration file `/usr/share/sonic/device/{platform}/{hwsku}/pmon_daemon_control.json`
* Check all the daemons running status in the daemon list

### Pass/Fail Criteria
* All the daemon status in the list shall be `RUNNING`

# Automation Design

This section outlines the design of scripts automating the SONiC platform test cases. The new pytest-ansible framework will be used. Sample code can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-mgmt/tree/master/tests).

## Folder Structure and Script Files
The pytest framwork supports flexible test discovery. The plan is to put all platform related scripts under `tests/platform`. Command like `pytest tests/platform` would be able to discover all `test_*.py` and `*_test.py` under `tests/platform`. No entry script is required.

The folder structure and sript files:
```
sonic-mgmt
|-- ansible
|-- tests
    |-- platform
        |-- psu_controller.py
        |-- test_platform_info.py
        |-- test_sfp.py
        |-- test_xcvr_info_in_db.py
        |-- test_sequential_restart.py
        |-- test_reload_config.py
        |-- test_cold_reboot.py
        |-- test_warm_reboot.py
        |-- test_fast_reboot.py
        |-- check_critical_services.py
        |-- check_interface_status.py
        |-- check_transceiver_status.py
        |--mellanox
           |-- test_hw_management_service.py
           |-- test_check_sfp_using_ethtool.py
           |-- test_check_sysfs.py
           |-- check_hw_mgmt_service.py
           |-- mellanox_psu_controller.py
```
Filename of scripts should follow this pattern:
* All scripts for test cases should start with `test_`.
* Put vendor specific test cases in dedicated folder. For example, all Mellanox specific scripts are put under subfolder "mellanox".
* Scripts hold helper functions or classes should start with `check_`, or other prefix as long as it does not conflict with above two patterns.
* The `sonic-mgmt/tests/platform/psu_controller.py` script has the definition of psu_controller fixture that is used in `test_platform_info.py`. The psu_controller fixture returns a PSU controller object for controlling the power on/off to PSUs of DUT. This script also defines the interface of PSU controller object in PsuControllerBase class. Vendor specific PSU controller must be implemented as a sublcass of PsuControllerBase and put under vendor subfolder. For example, Mellanox specific PSU controller is impelemented in `sonic-mgmt/tests/platform/mellanox/mellanox_psu_controller.py`.

With this convention, to run just the common test cases, use below commands:
* `py.test tests/platform/test_* <extra arguments>`

To run common and mellanox specific test cases:
* `py.test tests/platform/test_* tests/platform/mellanox/test_* <extra arguments>`

Please DO NOT use below commands to run tests:
* `py.test tests/platform <extra arguments>`
The reason is that this pattern will recursively collect all the test cases in test_*.py files under tests/platform, including vendor specific subfolders. If there are multiple vendor specific subfolders under this folder, this pattern will try to run all the common and all vendor specific test cases.

Because these scripts need to be upstreamed, community definitely will have lots of comments. To get feedback early, we can implement the scripts in two phases.

## Scripts to be implemented in phase1

| Test Case                                                              | Script                                                  | Common for all vendors? |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Case 1.1 Check platform information                                    | tests/platform/test_platform_info.py                    | Yes                     |
| Case 1.3 Check SFP status and configure SFP                            | tests/platform/test_sfp.py                              | Yes                     |
| Case 1.4 Check xcvrd information in DB                                 | tests/platform/test_xcvr_info_in_db.py                  | Yes                     |
| Case 2.1 Ensure that the hw-management service is running properly     | tests/platform/mellanox/test_hw_management_service.py   | No                      |
| Case 2.2 Check SFP using ethtool                                       | tests/platform/mellanox/test_check_sfp_using_ethtool.py | No                      |
| Case 2.3 Check SYSFS                                                   | tests/platform/mellanox/test_check_sysfs.py             | No                      |
| Case 2.4 Verify that `/var/run/hw-management` is mapped to docker pmon | tests/platform/mellanox/check_sysfs.py                  | No                      |

The psu_controller fixture will also be implemented in phase 1:
* `tests/platform/psu_controller.py`
* `tests/platform/mellanox/mellanox_psu_controller.py`

The scripts for testing sensors `ansible/roles/test/tasks/sensors_check.yml` simply calls `ansible/roles/sonic-common/tasks/sensors_check.yml`. We can conver it to pytest in the future.

## Scripts to be implemented in phase 2

| Test Case                              | Script                                                                                                                                     | Common for all vendors? |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Case 1.5 Sequential syncd/swss restart | tests/platform/test_sequential_restart.py                                                                                                  | Yes                     |
| Case 1.6 Reload configuration          | tests/platform/test_reload_config.py                                                                                                       | Yes                     |
| Case 1.7  COLD/WARM/FAST reboot        | tests/platform/test_reboot.py | Yes                     |

## Helper scripts

For the tasks that can be reused in testing, they can be organnized into separate helper script files `check_*.py`. The test case scripts can import these helper scripts and call the functions/classes defined in them.

| Reusable script              | Purpose                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| check_critical_services.py  | Check status of critical services for eg: wss, syncd, bgp, etc. Used by the test cases testing restart/reload/reboot.                 |
| check_hw_mgmt_service.py    | Check status of hw-management, thermal control process, fan speed, PWM setting. Used by the test cases testing restart/reload/reboot. |
| check_interface_status.py   | Check status of interfaces. Used by the test cases testing restart/reload/reboot.                                                     |
| check_sysfs.py              | Check the symbolic links under /var/run/hw-management. Used by the test case testing SYSFS.                                           |
| check_transceiver_status.py | Check the status of xcvrd information in DB. Used by the test case testing xcvrd and restart/reload/reboot.                           |

## Vendor specific steps

In common test cases, some steps may be vendor specific. For these steps, we can run different code based on the vendor information derived from the hw-sku. The hw-sku information can be retrieved from minigraph facts. For example:

```python
if sonic_asic_type in ["mellanox"]:
   do_something()
else:
   do_something_else()
```
