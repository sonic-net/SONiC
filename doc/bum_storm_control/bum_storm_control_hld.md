# About this Manual
This document provides general information about Broadcast, Unknown-unicast and unknown-Multicast storm-control feature implementation in SONiC.
# Scope
This document describes the functionality and high level design of Broadcast, Unknown-unicast and unknown-Multicast storm-control feature in SONiC. 




# Definition/Abbreviation
### Table 1: Abbreviations
| Term   | Meaning                                                |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| BUM   | Broadcast Unknown-unicast and unknown-Multicast         |


# 1 Feature Overview
A traffic storm occurs when packets flood the LAN, creating excessive traffic and degrading network performance. The type of traffic can be Broadcast, Unknown-unicast or unknown-Multicast (BUM). 
The storm-control feature allows the user to limit the amount of BUM traffic admitted to the system. This can be achieved by configuring the type of storm (Broadcast or Unknown-unicast or unknown-Multicast) and the corresponding kilo bits per second (kbps) parameter on a given physical interface. Traffic that exceeds the configured rate will be dropped. 
Unknown-multicast traffic consists of all multicast traffic which donot match any of the statically configured or dynamically learned multicast groups. 



## 1.1 Requirements


### 1.1.1 Functional Requirements
 1. Support configuration of Broadcast, Unknown-unicast and unknown-Multicast storm-control independently on physical interfaces.
 2. Support threshold rate configuration in kilo bits per second (kbps) in the range of 0 kbps to 100,000,000 kbps (100Gbps). 

### 1.1.2 Configuration and Management Requirements
This feature supports SONiC yang, SONiC CLI and mgmt framework interfaces(Klish, REST, gNMI).
 1. Support a CLI to add or delete broadcast, unknown-unicast and unknown-multicast storm-control on a physical interface as described in "Configuration Commands" section below. 
 2. Support show commands to display the storm-control configuration as described in "Show Commands" section below. 
 3. Support debug commands as described in "Debug Commands" section below.


### 1.1.3 Scalability Requirements
Storm-control configuration is done on physical ports. Hence it should be supported on all physical ports of the system. 

### 1.1.4 Warm Boot Requirements
Storm-control functionality should continue to work across warm reboot. 

- To support planned system warm boot.
- To support SWSS docker warm boot.


## 1.2 Design Overview


### 1.2.1 Basic Approach
The Policer Orchestration agent is used for handling BUM storm-control configuration. 

### 1.2.2 Container
No new containers are introduced. Functionality is added to the existing swss container. 

### 1.2.3 SAI Overview
The existing SAI policer and interface APIs shall be used to support this feature and they are available at below location, 
https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/master/inc/saipolicer.h <br>
https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/master/inc/saiport.h


The details of the changes will be discussed in the design section below.


# 2 Functionality
Refer to section 1
## 2.1 Target Deployment Use Cases
Any Layer-2 network segment where unknown-unicast / broadcast / unknown-multicast traffic storm should be  controlled. 


## 2.2 Functional Description
Refer to section 1.1

## 2.3 Limitations
BUM storm control 
- Configuration is not supported on VLAN and port-channel interfaces. User can configure on physical port which is part of a VLAN / port-channel.
- Statistics is not supported. 


# 3 Design
## 3.1 Overview


![Storm Control](images/storm_control_architecture.png "Figure 1: Storm control High Level Architecture")


__Figure 1: Storm Control High Level Architecture__

1) Storm-control configurations are done using SONiC yang / SONiC CLI / management framework. The configurations are parsed and stored in PORT_STORM_CONTROL Table in Configuration database.
2) The Policer Orchestration Agent subscribes to notifications from the PORT_STORM_CONTROL and parses the input parameters (interface, storm-control type, kbps). A policer_name is created internally by encoding the interface_name and storm_control_type.
3) create_policer SAI API is invoked to create a policer with the given input parameters. 
4) The identifier of the policer created is associated with the encoded policer_name.
5) The policer identifier is passed to set_port_attribute SAI API to set the appropriate type of storm-control on the port. 


## 3.2 DB Changes
This section describes the changes made to different DBs for supporting storm-control.


### 3.2.1 CONFIG_DB
A new table PORT_STORM_CONTROL is introduced in the configuration database for the purpose of storing storm-control configuration parameters. This table is filled by the management framework. 
#### PORT_STORM_CONTROL

    ;Store Storm Control configuration per physical port
    ;Status: work in progress
    ;storm control type - broadcast / unknown-unicast / unknown-multicast
    key     = PORT_STORM_CONTROL:port|storm_control_type ; Ethernet Interface Name and storm control type
    ;field  = value
    enabled = BIT          ; Is the storm control enabled (1) or disabled (0) on the interface 
    kbps     = 1*13 DIGIT   ; CIR value in kilo bits per second
         
### 3.2.2 APP_DB
No tables are introduced in APP_DB
### 3.2.3 STATE_DB
No tables are introduced in STATE_DB. 

### 3.2.4 ASIC_DB
No changes are introduced in ASIC_DB. 
### 3.2.5 COUNTER_DB
No changes are introduced in COUNTER_DB. 


## 3.3 Switch State Service Design
### 3.3.1 PolicerOrch changes 
Policer Orchestration agent is responsible for the following activities:
   - Subscribes to notifications on PORT_STORM_CONTROL entries in the CONFIG_DB. 
   - Creates an internal name for policer by encoding the interface name and storm-control type. 
   - Creates the policer based on the parameters and associates the policer identifier to internal name
   - Populates the port attribute SAI structures and pushes the entry to ASIC_DB. 


## 3.4 SAI
Storm-control SAI interface APIs are already defined. The table below represents the SAI attributes which shall be used for BUM storm-control.


###### Table 2: Storm Control SAI attributes
| Storm Control component  | SAI attributes                                         |                          
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Meter type               | SAI_POLICER_ATTR_METER_TYPE                            |
| Meter mode               | SAI_POLICER_ATTR_MODE                                  |
| CIR (bps)                | SAI_POLICER_ATTR_CIR                                   |
| Unknown-unicast policer  | SAI_PORT_ATTR_FLOOD_STORM_CONTROL_POLICER_ID           |
| Broadcast policer        | SAI_PORT_ATTR_BROADCAST_STORM_CONTROL_POLICER_ID       |
| Unknown-Multicast policer| SAI_PORT_ATTR_MULTICAST_STORM_CONTROL_POLICER_ID       |


The BUM storm-control feature can be enabled on a physical port. 

The **create_policer** SAI API is used to create the policer based on the policer parameters listed in Table 2.
   - Meter Type - Can be packets or bytes. Storm-control uses bytes meter type. 
   - Meter Mode - Can be st_tcm or tr_tcm or storm. Storm-control uses storm meter mode. 
   - CIR (bps) - Value of CIR given in bps. 

The **set_port_attribute** SAI API is used to set the policer on an interface. 
   - Unknown-unicast policer - Enables storm-control for unknown-unicast traffic received on the interface. 
   - Broadcast policer - Enables storm-control for broadcast traffic received on the interface. 
   - Unknown-multicast policer - Enables storm-control for unknown-multicast traffic received on the interface.

# 5 Error Handling
# 6 Serviceability and Debug
Debug commands as described in Debug Command section will be supported. Debug command output will be captured as part of tech support.
- A CLI error will be displayed via console and configuration will be rejected
- Internal processing errors within SwSS will be logged in syslog with ERROR level
- SAI interaction errors will be logged in syslog


# 7 Warm Boot Support
The storm-control setting on the port should be retained across warmboot so that the BUM storm traffic gets rate-limited as per the configured policer parameters. 


# 8 Scalability


Storm-control is a physical port parameter. Testing would be done by enabling storm-control on all the physical ports.

        before warm boot. 


## 9.5 Negative Test Cases
    23. Verify that storm-control configuration errors out when applied on port-channel or vlan interfaces. 
    24. Verify that error is returned when the same configuration is repeated on the interface. 
    25. Configure BUM storm-control on interface without providing kbps value and check that configuration is 
        not accepted. 
    26. Unconfigure BUM storm-control on interface by providing kbps as input and check that 
        additional / invalid parameter error is displayed. 
    27. Verify that invalid parameter error is displayed when value of kbps is out of range or invalid.
    28. Verify that invalid parameter / input error is displayed when invalid input is provided for storm-control type.
