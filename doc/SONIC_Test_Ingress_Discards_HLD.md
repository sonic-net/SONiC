#### Overview
The purpose is to test drop counters triggers on receiving specific packets by DUT.

The test assumes control plane traffic is disabled before test run by disabling VMs.

Destination IP address of the injected packet must be routable to ensure packet should not be routed via specific interface but dropped.

##### For Ethernet drop reasons:
```portstat -j``` - check ```RX_DRP```

##### For IP drop reasons:
```intfstat -j``` - check ```RX_ERR```

##### For ACL drop reasons:
```aclshow -a``` - check ```PACKETS COUNT```

#### Scope
The purpose of test cases is to verify that:
- appropriate packet drop counters trigger on SONIC system on expected value
- making sure that specific traffic drops correctly, according to sent packet and configured packet discards

#### Supported topologies:
```
t0
t1
t1-lag
ptf32
```

#### Discard groups covered by test cases

As different vendors can have diferent drop counters calculation, for example L2 and L3 drop counters can be combined and L2 drop counter will be increased for all ingress discards.
So for valid drop counters verification there is a need to distinguish wheter drop counters are combined or not for current vendor.
This can be done by checking platform name of the DUT.

##### Work need to be done based on this case
Create yml file which will contain list of regular expressions which match platform name of specific vendor who has combined drop counters calculation. Internally test framework will use this regular expressions to match current DUT platform name to determine whether drop counters are combined or not.

##### Example of file content:
tests/drop_counters/combined_drop_counters.yml
```
- "[REGEXP FOR VENDOR X]"
- "[REGEXP FOR VENDOR Y]"
```

#### SAI attributes
```SAI_PORT_STAT_IF_IN_DISCARDS``` - number of L2 discards

```SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_STAT_IN_ERROR_PACKETS``` - number of L3 discards

#### General test flow
##### Each test case will use the following port types:
- VLAN (T0)
- LAG (T0, T1-LAG)
- Router (T1, T1-LAG, PTF32)

##### Drop counters which are going to be checked
It depends on test objective.

Will be verified one of the following drop counters:
- Drop counter for L2 discards
- Drop counter for L3 discards
- Drop counter for ACL discards

##### Sent packet number:
N=5

##### step #1 - Disable VMs
Before test suite run - disable control plane traffic generation. Use "testbed-cli.sh" script with "disconnect-vms" option.

##### step #2 - Execute test scenario for all available port types depends on run topology (VLAN, LAG, Router)

- Select PTF ports to send and sniff traffic
- Clear counters on DUT. Use CLI command "sonic-clear counters"
- Inject N packet via PTF port selected for TX
- Check specific drop counter incremented on N (depends on test case)
	- If counter was not incremented on N, test fails with expected message
- Check other counters were not incremented on N based on sent packet type, sent port and expected drop reason (depends on test case)
	- If counter was incremented on N, test fails with expected message
- Check the packet was dropped by sniffing packet absence on PTF port selected for RX

##### step #3 - Enable VMs
Enable previously disabled VMs using "testbed-cli.sh" script with "connect-vms" option.

#### Run test
```
py.test --inventory ../ansible/inventory --host-pattern [DEVICE] --module-path ../ansible/library/ --testbed [DEVICE-TOPO] --testbed_file ../ansible/testbed.csv --junit-xml=./target/test-reports/ --show-capture=no --log-cli-level debug -ra -vvvvv ingress_discard/test_ingress_discard.py
```

#### Test cases
Each test case will be additionally validated by the loganalyzer utility.

Each test case will run specific traffic to trigger specific discard reasone.

Pytest fixture - "ptfadapter" is used to construct and send packets.

After packet is sent using source port index, test framework waits during 5 seconds for specific packet did not appear, due to ingress packet drop, on one of the destination port indices.

- When packet reaches SONIC DUT, it should be dropped according to the test objective
- Get L3 drop counter
- Verify drop counter incremented
- Get L2 drop counter
- Verify L2 drop counter is not incremented

#### Test case #18
##### Test objective

Verify DUT drops packet where SRC IP is link-local address

For ipv4: sip==169.254.0.0/16

Packet1 to trigger drop
```
...
###[ IP ]###
    version = 4
    ttl = [auto]
    proto = tcp
    src = [169.254.10.125]
    dst = [auto]
...
```

##### Get interfaces which are members of LAG, RIF and VLAN. Repeat defined test steps for each of those interfaces.

##### Test steps
- PTF host will send packet1
- When packet reaches SONIC DUT, it should be dropped according to the test objective
- Get L3 drop counter
- Verify drop counter incremented
- Get L2 drop counter
- Verify L2 drop counter is not incremented

#### Test case #19
##### Test objective

Verify DUT drops packet where DST IP is link-local address

#### Test case #21
##### Test objective

Verify egress RIF drop counter is not incremented while sending packets that are destined for a neighboring device but the egress link is down

Packet1 to send
```
...
###[ IP ]###
    version = 4
    ttl = [auto]
    proto = tcp
    src = [auto]
    dst = [auto]

```

##### Get interfaces which are members of LAG, RIF and VLAN. Repeat defined test steps for each of those interfaces.

##### Test steps
- Disable egress interface on DUT which is linked with neighbouring device
- Check ARP entry is cleared
- PTF host will send packet1
- Verify that no packets appeared/captured on disabled link
- Get L3 drop counter
- Verify drop counter is not incremented
- Get L2 drop counter
- Verify L2 drop counter is not incremented
- Enable back egress interface on DUT which is linked with neighbouring device
