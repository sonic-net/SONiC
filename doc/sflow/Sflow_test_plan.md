# SFlow Test Plan

## Overview

The purpose is to test the functionality of the sFlow monitoring system on the SONIC switch DUT . The test assumes that the Sonic device has been preconfigured according to the t0 topology.

### Scope

The test is targeting a running SONIC system with fully functioning configuration. Rather, it is testing the functionality of sFlow on the SONIC system by verifying that sFlow is monitoring traffic flow data correctly.

## Test Structure

### Setup Configuration

The test will run on the t0 testbed:

![testbed-t0.png](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/ansible/doc/img/testbed-t0.png?raw=true)

- 1 port from each port channel is used for traffic. Sflow is enabled on these 4 ports 
- 2 ports  from Vlan1000 are removed and used  to reach sflow collector in ptf docker .
- Traffic is sent from ptf docker with different packet sizes to the port channel interfaces  which are enabled with sflow .
- Collection is implemented using the sflowtool. Counter sampling output and flow sampling output are directed to a text file. The test script parses the text file and validates the data according to the polling/sampling rate configured and the interfaces enabled.
- Sflowtool to be installed in ptf docker to run these tests

### Test Cases

#### Test Case #1

##### Test objective

Verify that the SFLOW_COLLECTOR configuration additions and configuration deletions are processed by hsflowd.
