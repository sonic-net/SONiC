## 4. Overview

sFlow (defined in https://sflow.org/sflow_version_5.txt) is a standard-based sampling technology the meets the key requirements of network traffic monitoring on switches and routers. sFlow uses two types of sampling:

* Statistical packet-based sampling of switched or routed packet flows to provide visibility into network usage and active routes
* Time-based sampling of interface counters.

The sFlow monitoring system consists of:

 * sFlow Agents that reside in network equipment which gather network traffic and port counters and combines the flow samples and interface counters into sFlow datagrams and forwards them to the sFlow collector at regular intervals over a UDP socket. The datagrams consist of information on, but not limited to, packet header, ingress and egress interfaces, sampling parameters, and interface counters. A single sFlow datagram may contain samples from many flows.
 * sFlow collectors which receive and analyze the sFlow data.

 sFlow is an industry standard, low cost and scalable technique that enables a single analyzer to provide a network wide view.

## 5. Requirements

sFlow will be implemented in multiple phases:

### **Phase I:**

1. sFlow should be supported on physical interfaces.
2. sFlow should support 2 sFlow collectors.
3. sFlow collector IP can be either IPv4 or IPv6.
4. sFlow collector can be reachable via
	1. 	Front end port
	2. 	Management port
6. Default sFlow sample size should be set to 128 bytes.
7. Support sFlow related
	1. CLI show/config commands
	2. syslogs
8. sFlow counter support needed and config to change polling interval.

### **Phase II:**
1. Speed based sample rate setting (config sflow sample-rate speed...)
2. sFlow should be supported on portchannel interfaces.
2. Enhance CLI with session support (i.e create sessions add interfaces to specific sessions)
3. SNMP support for sFlow.

### **Phase III:**
1. sFlow extended switch support.
2. sFlow extended router support.

### Not planned to be supported:
1. Egress sampling support.
2. sFlow backoff mechanism (Drop the packets beyond configured CPU Queue rate limit).
3. sFlow over vlan interfaces.

## 6. Module Design

### 6.1 **Overall design**
The following figure depicts the sFlow container in relation to the overall SONiC architecture:

![alt text](../../images/sflow/sflow_architecture.png "SONiC sFlow Architecture")

The CLI is enhanced to provide configuring and display of sFlow parameters including sflow collectors, agent IP, sampling rate for interfaces. The CLI configurations currently only interact with the CONFIG_DB.

The newly introduced sflow container consists of:
* An instantiation of the InMon's hsflowd daemon (https://github.com/sflow/host-sflow described in https://sflow.net/documentation.php). The hsflowd is launched as a systemctl service. The host-sflow is customised to interact with SONiC subsystems by introducing a host-sflow/src/Linux/mod_sonic.c (described later)
* sflowmgrd : updates APP DB sFlow tables based on config updates

The swss container is enhanced to add the following component:
* sfloworch : which subscribes to the APP DB and acts as southbound interface to SAI for programming the SAI_SAMPLEPACKET sessions.
* copporch : Copporch gets the genetlink family name and multicast group from copp.json file, programs the SAI genetlink attributes and associates it with trap group present for sflow in copp.json

The syncd container is enhanced to support the SAI SAMPLEPACKET APIs.

The ASIC drivers need to be enhanced to:
* Associate the SAI_HOSTIF_TRAP_TYPE_SAMPLEPACKET to a specific genetlink channel and multicast group.
* Punt trapped samples to this genetlink group

The sflow container and changes to the existing components to support sflow are described in the following sections.

### 6.2 **Configuration and control flow**
The following figure shows the configuration and control flows for sFlow:

![alt text](../../images/sflow/sflow_config_and_control.png "SONiC sFlow Configuration and Control")

1. The user configures the sflow collector, agent, sampling related parameters (interfaces to be sampled and rate) and these configurations are added to the CONFIG DB.
2. The copporch (based on swssconfig/sample/00-copp.config.json) calls a SAI API that enables the ASIC driver to map the SAI_HOSTIF_TRAP_TYPE_SAMPLEPACKET trap to the specific genetlink channel and multicast group. The SAI driver creates the genetlink family and multicast group which will eventually be used to punt sFlow samples to hsflowd. If the SAI implementation uses the psample kernel driver (https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/psample/psample.c), the genetlink family "psample" and multicast group "packets" that the psample driver creates is to be used.
3. The sflowmgrd daemon watches the CONFIG DB's SFLOW_COLLECTOR table and updates the /etc/hsflowd.conf which is the configuration file for hsflowd. Based on the nature of changes, the sflowmgrd may restart the hsflowd service. The hsflowd service uses the collector, UDP port and agent IP information to open sockets to reach the sFlow collectors.
4. When hsflowd starts, the sonic module (mod_sonic) registered callback for packetBus/HSPEVENT_CONFIG_CHANGED opens a netlink socket for packet reception and registers an sflow sample handler over the netlink socket (HsflowdRx()).
5. Sampling rate changes are updated in the SFLOW table. The sflowmgrd updates sampling rate changes into SFLOW_TABLE in the App DB. The sfloworch subagent in the orchagent container processes the change to propagate as corresponding SAI SAMPLEPACKET APIs.

Below figures explain the flow for different commands from CLI to SAI

![alt text](../../images/sflow/sflow_enable.png "SONiC sFlow Enable command")

![alt text](../../images/sflow/sflow_disable.png "SONiC sFlow Disable command")

![alt text](../../images/sflow/sflow_intf_disable_all.png "SONiC Interface disable all command")

![alt text](../../images/sflow/sflow_intf_disable.png "SONiC Interface enable/disable command")

![alt text](../../images/sflow/sflow_intf_rate.png "SONiC Interface rate set command")


### 6.3 **sFlow sample path**
The following figure shows the sFlow sample packet path flow:

![alt text](../../images/sflow/sflow_sample_packet_flow.png "SONiC sFlow sample packet flow")

1. The ASIC (DMAs) an sflow sample and interrupts the ASIC driver
2. The ASIC driver ascertains that this is sample buffer that has been received as a result of sflow sampling being enabled for this interface.
3. The ASIC driver checks that SAI_HOSTIF_TRAP_TYPE_SAMPLEPACKETs are associated with a specific genetlink channel name and group. the ASIC driver encapsulates the sample in a genetlink buffer and adds the following netlink attributes to the sample : IIFINDEX, OIFINDEX, ORIGSIZE, SAMPLE, SAMPLE RATE. The genetlink buffer is sent via genlmsg_multicast().
4. The hsflowd daemon's HsflowdRx() is waiting on the specific genetlink family name's multicast group id and receives the encapsulated sample. The HsflowdRx parses and extracts the encapsulated sflow attributes and injects the sample to the hsflowd packet thread using takeSample().
5. The hsflowd packet thread accumulates sufficient samples and then constructs an sFlow UDP datagram and forwards to the configured sFlow collectors.

### 6.4 **sFlow counters**

The sFlow counter polling interval is set to 20 seconds. The pollBus/HSPEVENT_UPDATE_NIO callback caches the interface SAI OIDs during the first call by querying COUNTER_DB:COUNTERS_PORT_NAME_MAP. It periodically retrieves the COUNTER_DB interface counters and fills the necessary counters in hsflowd's SFLHost_nio_counters.

### 6.5 **CLI**

#### sFlow utility interface
* sflow [options] {config | show} ...

  An sflow utility command is provided to operate with sflow configuration
  Also, the **config** and **show** commands would be extended to include the sflow option.

#### Config commands

* **sflow collector add** *{collector-name} {ipv4-address | ipv6-address}* [**--port** *{number}*]

  Where:
  * collector-name is the unique name of the sFlow collector
  * ipv4-address : IP address of the collector in dotted decimal format for IPv4
  * ipv6-address : x: x: x: x::x format for IPv6 address of the collector (where :: notation specifies successive hexadecimal fields of zeros)
  * port (OPTIONAL): specifies the UDP port of the collector (the range is from 0 to 65535. The default is 6343.)
  * vrf (OPTIONAL): specifies the VRF the collector is on. Only 'default' and 'mgmt' are supported (The default is 'default')

  Note:
  * A maximum of 2 collectors is allowed.

 * **sflow collector del** *{collector-name}*

    Delete the sflow collector with the given name

* **sflow agent-id <add | del>** *{interface-name}*

  Where:
  * agent-id: specify the interface name whose ipv4 or ipv6 address will be used as the agent-id in sFlow datagrams.

  Note:
  * This setting is global (applicable to both collectors) and optional. Only a single agent-id is allowed. If agent-id is not specified (with this CLI),  an appropriate IP that belongs to the switch is used as the agent-id based on some simple heuristics.

* **sflow <enable|disable>**

  Globally, sFlow is disabled by default. When sFlow is enabled globally, the sflow deamon is started and sampling will start on all interfaces which have sFlow enabled at the interface level (see “config sflow interface…”).
When sflow is disabled globally, sampling is stopped on all relevant interfaces and sflow daemon is stopped.

* **sflow interface <enable|disable>** *<{interface-name}|**all**>*

  Enable/disable sflow at an interface level. By default, sflow is enabled on all interfaces at the interface level.  Use this command to explicitly disable sFlow for a specific interface. An interface is sampled if sflow is enabled globally as well as at the interface level.

  The “all” keyword is used as a convenience to enable/disable sflow at the interface level for all the interfaces.

* **sflow interface sample-rate** *{interface-name} {value}*

  Configure the sample-rate for a specific interface.

  The default sample rate for any interface is (ifSpeed / 1e6) where ifSpeed is in bits/sec.  So, the default sample rate based on interface speed is:

  * 1-in-1000 for a 1G link
  * 1-in-10,000  for a 10G link
  * 1-in-40,000  for a 40G link
  * 1-in-50,000  for a 50G link
  * 1-in-100,000  for a 100G link
  * 1-in-400,000  for a 400G link

  This default is chosen to allow the detection of a new flow of 10% link bandwidth in under 1 second. It is recommended not to change the defaults. This CLI is to be used only in case of exceptions (e.g., to set the sample-rate to the nearest power-of-2 if there are hardware restrictions in using the defaults)

  * value is the average number of packets skipped before the sample is taken. As per SAI samplepacket definition : "The sampling rate specifies random sampling probability as the ratio of packets observed to samples generated. For example a sampling rate of 256 specifies that, on average, 1 sample will be generated for every 256 packets observed."
  * Valid range 256:8388608.

* **sflow polling-interval** *{value}*

  The counter polling interval for all interfaces.

  * Valid range 0 or 5-300 seconds
  * Set polling-interval to 0 to disable

* **sflow sample-rate speed <100M|1G|10G|25G|40G|50G|100G>** *{value}*

  Set the sampling-rate for interfaces based on speed:
  e.g.
  ```
  config sflow sample-rate speed 100M 250
  config sflow sample-rate speed 1G 500
  config sflow sample-rate speed 40G 5000
  ```
  * This will override the default speed based setting (which is ifSpeed / 1e6 where ifSpeed is in bits/sec.)
  * If port speed changes, this setting will be used to determine the updated sample-rate for the interface.
  * The config sflow interface sample-rate {interface-name} {value} setting can still be used to override the speed based setting for specific interfaces.


#### Show commands

* **show sflow**
  * Displays the current configuration, global defaults as well as user configured values including collectors.
* **show sflow interface**
  * Displays the current running configuration of sflow interfaces.

#### Example SONiC CLI configuration ####

&#35; sflow collector add collector1 10.100.12.13

&#35; sflow collector add collector2 10.144.1.2 --port 6344 --vrf mgmt

### 6.6 **DB and Schema changes**

#### ConfigDB Table & Schema

A new SFLOW_COLLECTOR ConfigDB table entry would be added.
```
SFLOW_COLLECTOR|{{collector_name}}
    "collector_ip": {{ip_address}}
    "collector_port": {{ uint32 }} (OPTIONAL)
	"collector_vrf": {{string}}

; Defines schema for sFlow collector configuration attributes
key                    = SFLOW_COLLECTOR:collector_name   ; sFlow collector configuration
; field                = value
COLLECTOR_IP           = IPv4address / IPv6address        ; Ipv4 or IpV6 collector address
COLLECTOR_PORT         = 1*5DIGIT                         ; destination L4 port : a number between 0 and 65535
COLLECTOR_VRF          = "default" | "mgmt"               ; the VRF for the collector, currently only 'default' and 'mgmt' is supported

;value annotations
collector_name         = 1*16VCHAR
```

A new SFLOW table will be added which holds global configurations
```
; Defines schema for SFLOW table which holds global configurations
key                 = SFLOW
ADMIN_STATE         = "up" / "down"
POLLING_INTERVAL    = 1*3DIGIT      ; counter polling interval
AGENT_ID            = ifname        ; Interface name
```

A new SFLOW_SESSION table would be added.
```
key SFLOW_SESSION:interface_name
ADMIN_STATE     = "up" / "down"
SAMPLE_RATE     = 1*7DIGIT      ; average number of packets skipped before the sample is taken
```

#### AppDB & Schema

A new SFLOW_SESSION_TABLE is added to the AppDB:

```
; Defines schema for SFLOW_SESSION_TABLE which holds global configurations
key 			= SFLOW_SESSION_TABLE:interface_name
ADMIN_STATE	    = "up" / "down"
SAMPLE_RATE     = 1*7DIGIT      ; average number of packets skipped before the sample is taken
```

A new SFLOW_SAMPLE_RATE_TABLE table which maps interface speed to the sample rate for that speed is added to the AppDB
```
; Defines schema for SFLOW_SAMPLE_RATE which maps interface speed to sampling rate
key                 = SFLOW_SAMPLE_RATE_TABLE:speed
SAMPLE_RATE         = 1*7DIGIT      ; average number of packets skipped before the sample is taken
```
Where speed         = 1*6DIGIT      ; port line speed in Mbps

### 6.7 **sflow container**

hsflowd (https://github.com/sflow/host-sflow) is the most popular open source implementation of the sFlow agent and provides support for DNS-SD (http://www.dns-sd.org/) and can be dockerised. hsflowd supports sFlow version 5 (https://sflow.org/sflow_version_5.txt which supersedes RFC 3176). hsflowd will run as a systemd service within the sflow docker.

CLI configurations will be saved to the ConfigDB. Once the genetlink channel has been initialised and the sFlow traps mapped to the genetlink group, the hsflowd service is started. The service startup script will derive the /etc/hsflowd.conf from the ConfigDB. Config changes will necessitate restart of hsflowd. hsflowd provides the necessary statistics for the "show" commands. CLI "config" commands will retrieve the entries in the config DB.

#### sflowmgrd

The sflowmgrd consumes sflow config DB changes and updates the SFLOW APP DB tables.

The sflowmgrd daemon listens to SFLOW_COLLECTOR to construct the hsflowd.conf and start the hsflowd service.
The mapping between the SONiC sflow CLI parameters and the host-sflow is given below:

SONIC CLI parameter| hsflowd.conf equivalent
-------------------|------------------------
collector ip-address | collector.ip
collector port| collector.UDPPort
collecttor vrf| collector.vrf
agent ip-address | agentIP
max-datagram-size | datagramBytes
sample-rate | sampling

The master list of supported host-sflow tokens are found in host-sflow/src/Linux/hsflowtokens.h

sflowmgrd also listens to SFLOW to propogate the sampling rate changes to App DB SFLOW_TABLE.

#### hsflowd service

hsflowd provides an module adaptation layer for interfacing with the NOS. In the host-sflow repo, a src/Linux/mod_sonic.c adaption layer will be provided for hsflowd APIs to SONiC that deal with hsflowd initialization, configuration changes, packet sample consumption etc. More specifically, SONiC will register and provide callbacks for the following HSP events:

hsflowd bus/events|SONiC callback actions
------------------|----------------------
  pollBus/HSPEVENT_INTF_READ | select all switchports for sampling by default
  pollBus/HSPEVENT_INTF_SPEED | set sampling rate
  pollBus/HSPEVENT_UPDATE_NIO | poll interface state from STATE_DB:PORT_TABLE and update counter stats in SFLHost_nio_counters from COUNTER DB
  pollBus/HSPEVENT_CONFIG_CHANGED)| Change sampling rate (/ port speed changed)
  packetBus/HSPEVENT_CONFIG_CHANGED | open netlink socket and register HsflowdRx()

Refer to host-sflow/src/Linux/hsflowd.h for a list of events.

### 6.8 **SWSS and syncd changes**

### sFlowOrch

An sFlowOrch is introduced in the Orchagent to handle configuration requests. The sFlowOrch essentially facilitates the creation/deletion of samplepacket sessions as well as get/set of session specific attributes. sFlowOrch sets the genetlink host interface that is to be used by the SAI driver to deliver the samples.

Also, it monitors the SFLOW_SESSIONS_TABLE and PORT state to determine sampling rate / speed changes to derive and set the sampling rate for all the interfaces. It uses the SAI samplepacket APIs to set each ports's sampling rate.

### Rate limiting

Considering that sFlow backoff mechanism is not being implemented, users should consider rate limiting sFlow samples using the currently existing COPP mechanism (the COPP config (e.g. src/sonic-swss/swssconfig/sample/00-copp.config.json) can include appropriate settings for the samplepacket trap and initialised using swssconfig).

### 6.9 **SAI changes**

Creating sFlow sessions and setting attributes (e.g. sampling rate) is described in SAI proposal : https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/tree/master/doc/Samplepacket

As per the sFlow specification, each packet sample should have certain minimal meta data for processing by the sFlow analyser. The psample infrastructure (http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-sample.8.html) already describes the desired metadata fields (which the SAI driver needs to add to each sample):

```
SAMPLED PACKETS METADATA FIELDS
       The metadata are delivered to userspace applications using the
       psample generic netlink channel, where each sample includes the
       following netlink attributes:

       PSAMPLE_ATTR_IIFINDEX
              The input interface index of the packet, if there is one.

       PSAMPLE_ATTR_OIFINDEX
              The output interface index of the packet. This field is not
              relevant on ingress sampling

       PSAMPLE_ATTR_ORIGSIZE
              The size of the original packet (before truncation)

       PSAMPLE_ATTR_SAMPLE_GROUP
              The psample group the packet was sent to

       PSAMPLE_ATTR_GROUP_SEQ
              A sequence number of the sampled packet. This number is
              incremented with each sampled packet of the current psample
              group

       PSAMPLE_ATTR_SAMPLE_RATE
              The rate the packet was sampled with
```

The SAI driver may provide the interface OIDs corresponding to the IIFINDEX AND OIFINDEX. The hsflowd mod_sonic HsflowdRx() may have to map these correspondingly to the netdev ifindex. Note that the default PSAMPLE_ATTR_SAMPLE_GROUP that hsflowd expects is 1.

Rather than define a new framework for describing the metadata for sFlow use, SAI would re-use the framework that the psample driver (https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/psample/psample.c) currently uses. The psample kernel driver is based on the Generic Netlink subsystem that is described in https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/generic_netlink_howto. SAI ASIC drivers supporting sFlow may choose to use the psample.ko driver as-is or may choose to implement the generic netlink interface (that complies with the above listed metadata) using a private generic netlink family.

#### SAI Host Interface based on Generic Netlink

During SWSS init (as part of copporch), based on the swssconfig/sample/00-copp.config.json settings, sai_create_hostif_fn() is used to let the SAI driver create a special genetlink interface (type SAI_HOST_INTERFACE_TYPE_GENETLINK) and associate it with generic netlink family (SAI_HOST_INTERFACE_ATTR_NAME) and multicast group name (SAI_HOSTIF_ATTR_GENETLINK_MCGRP_NAME). Later, sai_create_hostif_table_entry_fn() is used to map SAI_HOSTIF_TRAP_TYPE_SAMPLEPACKET to the genetlink sai_host_if.

syncd/SAI implementations can use one of the following methods to create the genetlink interface:

1. As part of syncd/SAI driver init, a driver based on the standard psample driver (genetlink family ="psample" and multicast group "packets") may be installed which would create the genetlink. In this case the sai_create_hostif_fn() determines that the genetlink interface is already created and merely associates the sai_host_if to the genetlink.

2. The genetlink interface may alternatively be created during the call to sai_create_hostif_fn().


#### Changes in SAI to support the GENETLINK host interface

The changes in SAI to support the GENETLINK host interface is highlighted below:

    SAI_HOSTIF_ATTR_GENETLINK_MCGRP_NAME,

 /** Receive packets via Linux generic netlink interface */
    SAI_HOSTIF_TABLE_ENTRY_CHANNEL_TYPE_GENETLINK
```
#### Creating a GENETLINK Host Interface

Below is an example code snip that shows how a GENETLINK based host inerface is created. It is assumed that the application has already installed the psample.ko and created multicast group 100.

```
// Create a Host Interface based on generic netlink
sai_object_id_t host_if_id;
sai_attribute_t sai_host_if_attr[3];
 
sai_host_if_attr[0].id=SAI_HOST_INTERFACE_ATTR_TYPE;
sai_host_if_attr[0].value=SAI_HOST_INTERFACE_TYPE_GENETLINK;
 
sai_host_if_attr[1].id= SAI_HOST_INTERFACE_ATTR_NAME;
sai_host_if_attr[1].value="psample";
 
sai_host_if_attr[2].id= SAI_HOSTIF_ATTR_GENETLINK_MCGRP_NAME;
sai_host_if_attr[2].value="packets";

sai_create_host_interface_fn(&host_if_id, 9, sai_host_if_attr);
```

### Mapping a sFlow (SAI_HOSTIF_TRAP_TYPE_SAMPLEPACKET) trap to a GENETLINK host interface multicast group id

Below is the code snip that outlines how an sFlow trap is mapped to the GENETLINK host interface created in the previous section.

```
// Configure the host table to receive traps on the generic netlink socket

sai_object_id_t host_table_entry;
sai_attribute_t sai_host_table_attr[9];
 
sai_host_table_attr[0].id=SAI_HOSTIF_TABLE_ENTRY_ATTR_TYPE;
sai_host_table_attr[0].value= SAI_HOST_INTERFACE_TABLE_ENTRY_TYPE_TRAP_ID;
 
sai_host_table_attr[1].id= SAI_HOSTIF_TABLE_ENTRY_ATTR_TRAP_ID;
sai_host_table_attr[1].value=sflow_trap_id; // Object referencing SAMPLEPACKET trap

sai_host_table_attr[2].id= SAI_HOSTIF_TABLE_ENTRY_ATTR_CHANNEL;
sai_host_table_attr[2].value=  SAI_HOSTIF_TABLE_ENTRY_CHANNEL_TYPE_GENETLINK;

sai_host_table_attr[3].id= SAI_HOSTIF_TABLE_ENTRY_ATTR_HOST_IF;
sai_host_table_attr[3].value=host_if_id; // host interface of type file descriptor for GENETLINK

sai_create_hostif_table_entry_fn(&host_table_entry, 4, sai_host_table_attr);
```

It is assumed that the trap group and the trap itself have been defined using sai_create_hostif_trap_group_fn() and sai_create_hostif_trap_fn().

## 7 **Warmboot support**

sFlow packet/counter sampling should not be affected after a warm reboot. In case of a planned warm reboot, packet sampling will be stopped.

## 8 **sFlow in Virtual Switch**

On the SONiC VS, SAI calls would map to the tc_sample commands on the switchport interfaces (http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-sample.8.html).

## 9 **Build**

* The host-sflow package will be built with the mod_sonic callback implementations using the FEATURES="SONIC" option

## 10 **Restrictions**
* /etc/hsflowd.conf should not be modified manually. While it should be possible to change /etc/hsflowd.conf manually and restart the sflow container, it is not recommended.
* configuration updates will necessitate hsflowd service restart
