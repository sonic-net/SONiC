## Overview

This document is an updated version of the existing everflow test plan: https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/wiki/Everflow-test-plan

The purpose is to test functionality of Everflow on the SONIC switch DUT with and without LAGs configured, closely resembling production environment.
The test assumes all necessary configuration, including Everflow session and ACL rules, LAG configuration and BGP routes, are already pre-configured on the SONIC switch before test runs.

### Scope
The test is targeting a running SONIC system with fully functioning configuration.
The purpose of the test is not to test specific SAI API, but functional testing of Everflow on SONiC system, making sure that traffic flows correctly, according to BGP routes advertised by BGP peers of SONIC switch, and the LAG configuration.

NOTE: Everflow+LAG test will be able to run **only** in the testbed specifically created for LAG.

### Summary of the existing everflow test plan

The existing everflow test plan only covers ingress mirroring. ACL rules are added to ACL table of type "MIRROR". And by default, packets are only checked against the ACL rules on ingress stage. On ports that are bound to everflow ACL table, any ingress packets hitting the ACL rules are copied to associated mirror destination in GRE tunnel.

Two packet directions are covered in the exist testing: SPINE -> TOR ports and TOR -> SPINE ports. When the injected packets hit any of the configured ACL rules in the ingress stage, the packets will be mirrored to configured mirror destination. GRE tunnel is used for sending mirrored packets with src, dst IP and other parameters configured in the mirror session. Below test cases are used for verifying that the DUT switch can properly forwarded the mirrored packets according to different routing configurations for mirror session destination.

Example ACL table in config_db for everflow testing, type of the table is `MIRROR`:
```
{
    "ACL_TABLE": {
        "EVERFLOW": {
            "policy_desc": "EVERFLOW",

### Extend the test plan to cover both ingress and egress mirroring

#### What new enhancements need to be covered?

##### Egress ACL table
In Jan 2019, egress ACL table support is added (https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/pull/322, https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/pull/741) to SONiC. Then ACL table can have an extra field `stage` indicting on which stage will the ACL rules be checked against packets. If the `stage` is ignored or is set to 'ingress', the behavior is same as before, ingress packets will be checked against ACL rules. If the `stage` field is set to 'egress', then on ports bound to ACL table, egress packets will be checked against the ACL rules and will be handled according to the action configured for the ACL rules. The action could be `PACKET_ACTION` or `MIRROR_ACTION`.

##### Egress mirroring
Besides the egress ACL table support, a recent enhancement (Design: https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/pull/411 Implementations: https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/pull/963 https://github.com/Azure/sonic-utilities/pull/575) added egress mirroring support. This enhancement added two ACL rule action types based on the existing mirroring action `MIRROR_ACTION`:
* MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION
* MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION

The `MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION` type new. But its behavior is same as the existing ingress mirroring. Packets hit ACL rule will be mirrored at the ingress stage.
The `MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION` is a new action type which is for egress mirroring. It means that on ports bound to everflow ACL table, when packets hit ACL rules of that table, the packets will be mirrored at the egress stage. The original `MIRROR_ACTION` is kept for backward compatibility and it is implicitly set to "ingress" by default.

Combining these two enhancements, there are 4 scenarios for everflow.
1. ACL table of type `MIRROR` have `stage` field ignored or set to "ingress". Action type of ACL_RULE is `MIRROR_ACTION` or `MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION`.
2. ACL table of type `MIRROR` have `stage` field ignored or set to "ingress". Action type of ACL_RULE is `MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION`.
3. ACL table of type `MIRROR` have `stage` field set to "egress". Action type of ACL_RULE is `MIRROR_ACTION` or `MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION`.
4. ACL table of type `MIRROR` have `stage` field set to "egress". Action type of ACL_RULE is `MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION`.

Expected behaviors for the combinations:

| -                                  | ACL table stage: ingress                                 | ACL table stage: egress                                |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Action type: MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION | Ingress packets hit ACL rules, mirrored at ingress stage | Not applicable                                         |
| Action type: MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION  | Ingress packets hit ACL rules, mirrored at egress stage  | Egress packets hit ACL rules, mirrored at egress stage |

Since not all the combinations are supported by all vendors, the enhancement also added ACL capability detection. The supported ACL action types at different stage are detected and stored in redis. The below is an example of showing detected capabilities:
```
$ redis-cli -n 6 hgetall 'SWITCH_CAPABILITY|switch'
 1) "MIRROR"
 2) "true"
 3) "MIRRORV6"
 4) "true"
 5) "ACL_ACTIONS|INGRESS"
 6) "PACKET_ACTION,REDIRECT_ACTION,MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION"
 7) "ACL_ACTIONS|EGRESS"
 8) "PACKET_ACTION,MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION"
 9) "ACL_ACTION|PACKET_ACTION"
1)  "DROP,FORWARD"
```
In the above example output, two everflow combinations are supported on the platform being checked:
* INGRESS stage, MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION
* EGRESS stage, MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION

This test plan needs to be extended to cover both the existing everflow function and the newly added capabilities.

#### Some existing areas not covered by the existing scripts

##### ACL rule for matching "IN_PORTS"
Now the SONiC ACL rules support matching "IN_PORTS". New ACL rule for matching "IN_PORTS" need to be added and covered.

#### ACL rule for matching ICMP type and code
The SONiC ACL rules also support matching ICMP type and code. New ACL rules for matching ICMP type and code need to be added and covered. The acl-loader utility does not support ICMP type and code yet. The sonic-cfggen tool will be used for directly loading such ACL rules to config_db.

##### IPv6 everflow
The existing scripts only covered IPv6. IPv6 is also supported by SONiC now. The scripts need to be extended to cover IPv6 everflow too. To cover IPv6:
* Everflow ACL table of type "MIRRORV6" needs to be defined and loaded during testing.
* Different stages (ingress & egress) also need to be covered.
* Different ACL rule mirror actions also need to be covered.
* New set of IPv6 ACL rules need to be defined and loaded during testing.
* The PTF script needs to be extended to inject and monitor IPv6 packets.

#### How to extend the testing

To cover the new enhancements, the existing scripts need to be extended:
* The existing structure, sub-tests and PTF scripts can be reused.
* Add new sets of configurations.
* We can refactor the run_test.yml to run the existing sub-tests in multiple iteration. Each iteration loads a different set of ACL table and ACL rules configuration.
* Adjust initialization of variables used in testing if needed.
* Add a new class in the existing PTF script to inject and monitor IPv6 packets.
* Add a sub-test and add a new class in the PTF script to cover ACL rule matching "IN_PORTS".

In a summary, the extended scripts need to do below work:
1. Firstly the script need to get capability info of the DUT from hard coded resource, then check against the detected capabilities in DB. Fail the test if capabilities do not match.
2. Create everflow ACL table with different stage setting. Load ACL rules with different action type.
3. Run test cases in the existing scripts (8 test cases at the time of writing).
4. Ensure that each combination of the supported ACL table stages and ACL rule action types are covered.

Summary of the possible combinations:

| Combinations                   | ACL table stage: ingress | ACL table stage: egress |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| ACL Rule MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION | [x]                      | N/A                     |
| ACL Rule MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION  | [x]                      | [x]                     |

Totally there are 3 possible combinations. Not all the combinations are supported by all platforms. The actual combinations to be tested are determined the actual DUT platform.

Switch's ACL capability can be queried from DB table `SWITCH_CAPABILITY|switch`. The testing script can query ACL capability first. And then run the supported combinations, skip the unsupported combinations.

For example, if query SWITCH_CAPABILITY got below results:
```
$ redis-cli -n 6 hgetall "SWITCH_CAPABILITY|switch"
1) "ACL_ACTIONS|INGRESS"
2) "PACKET_ACTION,REDIRECT_ACTION,MIRROR_ACTION_INGRESS"
3) "ACL_ACTIONS|EGRESS"
4) "PACKET_ACTION,MIRROR_ACTION_EGRESS"
...
```
Then the platform only supports two combinations:
* ACL table stage ingress + ACL Rule MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION
* ACL table stage egress + ACL Rule MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION

The third combination would be skipped on this platform.

#### Combine the existing test cases

Some of the existing test cases are similar and doing repetitive testing. We remove and combine them to have a shorter list of test cases:
* Test case #1 is covered in #2, #3 and #4. It can be removed.
* Test case #2 and #3 can be combined to one case.
* Test case #5 is covered in #6. It can be removed.

### Test configurations

#### ACL table configurations

New ACL tables of type MIRROR and MIRRORv6 need to be created in testing. The new ACL tables also need to set different values for their "stage" attribute.

### Related **DUT** CLI commands

Summary of the CLI commands that will be used for configuring DUT.

#### `sonic-cfggen` Advanced config_db updating tool

This is the advanced tool for updating the config_db. It can be used for adding/removing ACL tables, ACL rules, mirror sessions and many more other configurations.

Some example usages:

* `sonic-cfggen -j <configuration_json_file> --write-to-db`: Load configuration in json format to config_db. The json file could be ACL table configuration.
* `sonic-cfggen -d -v ACL_TABLE`: Dump current ACL_TABLE configuration from config_db.
* `sonic-cfggen -d -v ACL_RULE`: Dump current ACL_RULE configuration from config_db.

#### `config acl add table <table_name> <table_type>` Add ACL table

Usage: `config acl add table [OPTIONS] <table_name> <table_type>`

This is the formal command for adding ACL table. ACL table added using this command is associated with all interfaces. If ACL table associated with a fraction of the interfaces is needed, the above `sonic-cfggen` method can be used. On versions that this formal command is not supported yet, the `sonic-cfggen` tool can be used.

#### `config acl remove table <table_name>` Remove ACL table

Usage: `config acl remove table [OPTIONS] <table_name>`

This is the formal command for removing ACL table.

#### `config acl update` Update ACL rules

Usages:
* `config acl update full [OPTIONS] FILE_NAME`
* `config acl update incremental [OPTIONS] FILE_NAME`

This is the formal command for loading ACL rules configuration from file specified by the FILE_NAME.

#### `acl-loader` Update ACL rules

Under the hood, the `config acl update` command called this `acl-loader` tool to load ACL rules configurations. For example:
* `acl-loader update full <acl_rule_configuration_json_file> [--session_name=<session_name> --mirror_stage=<ingress|egress>]`: Load acl rules specified in a json file to config_db.

On versions that the formal `config acl update` is not supported yet, this `acl-loader` tool or the `sonic-cfggen` tool can be used.

The acl-loader utility does not support load ACL rules matching ICMP type and code yet as the time of writing. The `sonic-cfggen` tool  will be used for loading ACL rules matching ICMP type&code.


#### `aclshow` Show ACL rule counters

This tool is for collecting ACL rule counters. For example:
* `aclshow -a`

#### `config mirror_session` Configure everflow mirror session

This tool is for configuring everflow mirror session. For example:
* `config mirror_session add <session_name> <src_ip> <dst_ip> <dscp> <ttl> [gre_type] [queue]`

## Test structure

### Overall structure

The extended ansible test playbook will have below parts:
1. Prepare some variables for testing
2. Add everflow configuration
3. Run everflow sub-tests
4. Clear everflow configuration
5. Repeat steps 1-3 for other configuration scenarios

The subsequent sections will have more detailed description of part

### Prepare some variables for testing

Firstly, some variables need to be prepared for testing. For example, the source ports for injecting traffic. The expected destination ports for mirrored packets.

### Add everflow configuration

Before run the sub-tests for each scenario, the scripts need to setup by loading configurations to DUT for the scenario to be covered.

There will be j2 template files for generating ACL tables and ACL rules configurations. Ansible playbook will generate ACL tables and ACL rules json configuration files to DUT based on these templates, switch capability and running topology. Then commands `sonic-cfggen` and `acl-loader` can be used for loading the configurations.

Different sets of configuration files will be generated for different test scenarios:
* IPv4 in IPv4
  * ACL table: MIRROR, ingress; IPv4 ACL rules, MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv4 src & dst IP address
  * ACL table: MIRROR, ingress; IPv4 ACL rules, MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv4 src & dst IP address
  * ACL table: MIRROR, egress; IPv4 ACL rules, MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv4 src & dst IP address
* IPv4 in IPv6
  * ACL table: MIRROR, ingress; IPv4 ACL rules, MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv6 src & dst IP address
  * ACL table: MIRROR, ingress; IPv4 ACL rules, MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv6 src & dst IP address
  * ACL table: MIRROR, egress; IPv4 ACL rules, MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv6 src & dst IP address
* IPv6 in IPv4
  * ACL table: MIRRORV6, ingress; IPv6 ACL rules, MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv4 src & dst IP address
  * ACL table: MIRRORV6, ingress; IPv6 ACL rules, MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv4 src & dst IP address
  * ACL table: MIRRORV6, egress; IPv6 ACL rules, MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv4 src & dst IP address
* IPv6 in IPv6
  * ACL table: MIRRORV6, ingress; IPv6 ACL rules, MIRROR_INGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv6 src & dst IP address
  * ACL table: MIRRORV6, ingress; IPv6 ACL rules, MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv6 src & dst IP address
  * ACL table: MIRRORV6, egress; IPv6 ACL rules, MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION; Mirror session IPv6 src & dst IP address

Totally there are 12 scenarios to cover. To make the scripts flexible, command line options should be added for selecting which scenarios to run.

#### ACL tables

For each test scenario, an ACL table configuration need to be created and loaded to DUT. Command `sonic-cfggen` can be used to load the ACL table configuration into config_db. Command syntax:  `sonic-cfggen -j <acl_table_configuration_filename> --write-to-db`.

Example ACL table configuration files to be generated for each scenario:
* ACL table: MIRROR, ingress

            "stage": "egress"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Mirror sessions

For each scenario, a mirror session is required. Totally two types of mirror sessions are required for all the scenarios:
* Mirror session using IPv4 source and destination IP addresses.
* Mirror session using IPv6 source and destination IP addresses.

The script will configure appropriate mirror session using `config mirror_session` while testing each of the scenario.

Add mirror_session using IPv4 source and destination IP addresses:
```
$ config mirror_session add session_v4 1.1.1.1 2.2.2.2 8 64 0x6558 0
$ acl-loader show session
Name        Status    SRC IP     DST IP    GRE     DSCP    TTL    Queue
----------  --------  ---------  --------  ------  ------  -----  -------
session_v4  inactive  1.1.1.1    2.2.2.2   0x6558  8       64     0
```

Add mirror_session using IPv6 source and destination IP addresses:
```
$ config mirror_session add session_v6 2000::1:1:1:1 2000::2:2:2:2 8 64 0x6558 0
$ acl-loader show session
Name        Status    SRC IP          DST IP          GRE     DSCP    TTL    Queue
----------  --------  -------------   -------------   ------  ------  -----  -------
session_v6  inactive  2000::1:1:1:1   2000::2:2:2:2   0x6558  8       64     0
```

#### ACL rules

Generate different sets of ACL rules from template. Load the ACL rules using below command:
`acl-loader update full <acl_rule_configuration_json_file> --session_name=<mirror_session_name> --mirror_stage=<ingress|egress>`

For IPv4 testing, the ACL rules template:
```
{
    "acl": {
        "acl-sets": {
            "acl-set": {
                "{{ acl_table_name }}": {
                    "acl-entries": {
                        "acl-entry": {

                                    "sequence-id": 10
                                },
                                "input_interface": {
                                    "interface_ref": {
                                        "config": {
                                            "interface": "{{ acl_in_ports }}"
                                        }
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For example, if loaded IPv4 ACL rules into ACL table EF_EGRESS, used MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION, used mirror session session_v4, they should be like below in config_db:
```
{
    "ACL_RULE": {
        "EF_EGRESS|RULE_1": {

            "L4_SRC_PORT_RANGE": "4672-4681",
            "MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION": "session_v4",
            "PRIORITY": "9992"
        },
        "EF_EGRESS|RULE_9": {
            "L4_DST_PORT_RANGE": "4672-4681",

    }
}
```

To cover ACL rule matching ICMP type and code, additional ACL configuration is required. Since the acl-loader utility does not support parsing and loading ACL rules matching ICMP type&code, the advanced configuration tool `sonic-cfggen` will be used.

Firstly, scripts need to prepare json file for ACL rules matching ICMP type&code from j2 template. To cover ICMPv4 and ICMPv6, two templates are required.

For matching ICMPv4:
```
{
    "ACL_RULE": {
        "{{ ACL_TABLE_NAME }}|RULE_12": {
            "MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION": "{{ MIRROR_SESSION_NAME }}",
            "PRIORITY": "9988",
            "ICMP_TYPE": "8",
            "ICMP_CODE": "0"
        }
}
```

For matching ICMPv6:
```
{
    "ACL_RULE": {
        "{{ ACL_TABLE_NAME }}|RULE_12": {
            "MIRROR_EGRESS_ACTION": "{{ MIRROR_SESSION_NAME }}",
            "PRIORITY": "9988",
            "ICMPV6_TYPE": "128",
            "ICMPV6_CODE": "0"
        }
}
```

Then use the `sonic-cfggen` tool to dump the current ACL rules configuration from config_db:
`$ sonic-cfggen -d -v ACL_RULE`.

Generate appropriate ICMP ACL rule configuration json file from j2 templates according to current testing scenario. Combine the dumped ACL rules with the ICMP ACL rules. Load the combined ACL rules into config_db using `sonic-cfggen` again:
`$ sonic-cfggen -j <combined_acl_rules_json_file> --write-to-db`

### Run test

For each configuration scenario, we need to run all the sub-tests. Everflow sub-tests consists of a number of test cases. Each of the test case is executed with log analyzer enabled, for example:

1. Run loganalyzer 'init' phase
2. Run a everflow test case
3. Run loganalyzer 'analyze' phase

Each test case may involve with with one or more classes defined in the PTF script.

#### PTF Test

The everflow test cases eventually call the ptf scripts to do the actual testing. The PTF scripts inject packets into DUT and validate traffic forwarded by DUT.

PTF test will generate traffic between ports and make sure it mirrored according to the configured Everflow session and ACL rules. Depending on the testbed topology and the existing configuration (e.g. ECMP, LAGS, etc) packets may arrive to different ports. Therefore ports connection information will be generated from the minigraph and supplied to the PTF script.

The `EverflowTest` class in everflow_tb_test.py need to be extended to cover IPv6 testing. Need some new methods for sending and validating IPv6 packets.

## Test cases

Each test case will be additionally validated by the loganalyzer utility.

Each test case will add dynamic Everflow ACL rules at the beginning and remove them at the end.

Each test case will run traffic for persistent and dynamic Everflow ACL rules.

Each test case will analyze Everflow packet header and payload (if mirrored packet is equal to original). In case of egress mirroring, verify that TTL of the mirrored packet in GRE tunnel is decremented comparing with the injected packet.

### Test case \#1 - Packets mirrored to best match resolved route

#### Test objective

Verify that mirrored packets are forwarded to the best match route for the session destination IP.

#### Test steps

- Create another route with unresolved next hop.
- Send packets that hit each Everflow ACL rule.
- Verify that the packets are mirrored to dst_port_1 with correct Everflow header.

- Remove the route with unresolved next hop. Create another route with best match prefix and resolved next hop on dst_port_2
