## 1. High level data flow

On high level, the SmartSwitch HA supporting multiple modes:

* **DPU-level passthru**: The HA is running on DPU level by DPU itself. In this mode, SmartSwitch HA control plane doesn't drive the HA state machine, but passthru the HA operations to DPU and handles the HA role change notification from DPU accordingly for state reporting and help setting up the right traffic forwarding rules when needed.
* **DPU-level active-standby**: The HA is handled on DPU level. Unlike passthru mode, SmartSwitch HA control plane will drive the HA state machine, and drives all ENIs on the same DPU to the same HA state. The traffic forwarding rule is handled on DPU level.
* **ENI-level active-standby**: The traffic forwarding rule and the HA state machine is handled on ENI level.

The mode can be set on HA set, and all modes are sharing similar high level work flow shown as below.

> Please note that:
>
> 1. The DPU DB in the following graphs are actually placed on the NPU side, due to CPU and memory constraints on DPU. Hence, the communication between `hamgrd` and DPU DB is local and doesn't need to go through PCIe bus.
> 2. Each DPU has its own hamgrd instance, so they can be updated independently from each other as part of DPU updates.

### 1.1. Upstream config programming path

The graph below shows how HA related config are programmed into the NPU and DPU DBs from our upstream services, then being handled by `hamgrd` and `swss`.

### 1.2. State generation and handling path

Whenever device or data path state is changed, we will need to handle them and update the HA related setup accordingly.

The workflow below shows the high level data flow for handling the state changes. There are 2 main paths:

1. BFD probe state change path: When the BFD probe state is changed, `swss` will update the route or ACL rules accordingly to point the traffic to the reachable DPU.
2. DPU state change path: When `pmon` is reporting device issues or we detected data path problem from counters, `hamgrd` will update the HA state machine and the traffic forwarding rules accordingly.

## 2. Database Schema

> NOTE:
>
> * Only the configuration that is related to HA is listed here and please check [SONiC-DASH HLD](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/dash/dash-sonic-hld.md) to see other fields.
> * Although the per-DPU database is for each DPU, but they are not running on DPU side, but on NPU side. The communication between `hamgrd` and DPU DB is local and doesn't need to go through PCIe bus.

### 2.1. External facing configuration tables

## 3. Telemetry

To properly monitor the HA related features, we provides the following telemetry for monitoring it.

The telemetry will cover both state and counters, which can be mapped into `DPU_STATE_DB` or `DPU_COUNTERS_DB`.

We will focus on only the HA counters below, which will not include basic counters, such as ENI creation/removal or generic DPU health/critical event counters, even though some of them works closely with HA workflows.

### 3.1. HA state and related health signals

To help simplify checking the HA states, `hamgrd` will aggregate the HA states and related health signals and store them in the HA scope state table.

Please refer to the [HA scope state](#2211-ha-scope-state) table in NPU DB for detailed DB schema design.

### 3.2. Traffic forwarding related

The following states and counters will help us monitor the NPU-to-DPU tunnel for traffic forwarding.

#### 3.2.1. NPU-to-DPU probe status (Per-HA Scope)

This is managed by `swss` via overlay ECMP with BFD. Please refer to its HLD [here](https://github.com/r12f/SONiC/blob/user/r12f/ha/doc/vxlan/Overlay%20ECMP%20with%20BFD.md).

#### 3.2.2. NPU-to-DPU tunnel counters (Per-HA Scope)

On NPU side, we should have following counters to monitor how the NPU-to-DPU tunnel is working:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| packets_forwarded | Number of packets hitting the traffic forwarding rule. |
| bytes_forwarded | Number of bytes hitting the traffic forwarding rule. |

> TODO: Can we have counters for discards, error and oversize?

### 3.3. DPU traffic handling related

On DPU side, we should have following counters to monitor how the DPU is handling the traffic.

#### 3.3.1. DPU level counters (Per-DPU)

Although majority of the counters will be tracked on ENI level, but before the packet is landed on an ENI, it might fail in other places, such as incorrect packet format and so on. These counters will be tracked separately and will be stored per port basis in the port counters.

Here are some examples of port counters we have:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SAI_PORT_STAT_IF_IN/OUT_UCAST_PKTS | Number of packets received / sent. |
| SAI_PORT_STAT_IF_IN/OUT_OCTETS | Total bytes received / sent. |
| SAI_PORT_STAT_IF_IN/OUT_DISCARDS| Number of incoming/outgoing packets get discarded. |
| SAI_PORT_STAT_IF_IN/OUT_ERRORS| Number of incoming/outgoing packets have errors like CRC error. |
| SAI_PORT_STAT_ETHER_RX/TX_OVERSIZE_PKTS | Number of incoming/outgoing packets exceeds the MTU. |

For the full list of port counters, please refer to the `sai_port_stat_t` structure in [SAI header file](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/master/inc/saiport.h).

Besides the standard SAI stats provided by each port, we also have the following counters extended in DASH:

#### 3.3.2. ENI-level traffic counters (Per-ENI)

Once the packet lands on an ENI, we should have the following counters to monitor how much traffic is handled by each ENI:

| SAI_ENI_STAT_(/OUTBOUND_/INBOUND_)TX_PACKETS | Total number of packets sent by ENI (overall/outbound/inbound) pipeline. |

#### 3.3.3. ENI-level pipeline drop counters (Per-ENI)

When the packet is landed on the ENI going throught each match stages, it might be dropped due to no entries can be matched, such as routing or CA-PA mapping. In order to show these drops, we should have the following counters:

| Name | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| SAI_ENI_STAT_OUTBOUND_ROUTING_ENTRY_MISS_DROP_PKTS | Number of packets that are dropped due to outbound routing entry not found. |
| SAI_ENI_STAT_OUTBOUND_CA_PA_ENTRY_MISS_DROP_PKTS | Number of packets that are dropped due to outbound routing entry not found. |

| SAI_ENI_STAT_(INLINE/TIMED)_FLOW_SYNC_PACKET_TX_PACKETS | The number of inline/timed flow sync packets that this ENI sent. |

Besides the packet level counters, we should also have flow operation level counters:

* The number of flow operations can be different from the number of flow sync packets. Depending on implementation, a single flow sync packet can carry multiple flow operations.
* The flow operation could fail or be ignored by ENI.
  * Failed means it is unexpected to receive packet, and we failed to process it.
  * Ignored means packet is expected be received, but we should ignore the flow operation inside and move on without dropping the packet. E.g., more packet arrives before flow sync is ack'ed.

#### 3.4.3. Bulk sync related counters (Per-HA Set)

The control plane data channel will be used for bulk sync. It is implemented using a gRPC server on each DPU.
