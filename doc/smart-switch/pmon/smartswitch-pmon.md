## 1. Introduction
SmartSwitch offloads the Packet Processors (NPUs) and the host CPUs, freeing up resources for application performance, thereby performing layer four to layer seven functions in a cost effective and space saving way. 

The specialized DPUs when built into a regular switch, can provide such a capability, which is being referred as SmartSwitch.
Platform monitor PMON in SONiC is a container responsible for chassis management functions to ensure proper operation of the devices and peripherals in the chassis there by ensuring the proper operation of the product. 

The typical lifecycle of a network switch product involves the following stages.

<p align="center"><img src="./images/lifecycle.svg"></p>

The following sub-tasks are performed under each stage
* Onboarding
    * Boot, Shutdown, Power Cycle
    * Reset, PCIe-Reset
* Monitoring
    * Device State (dpu_state)
    * Sensors, PSUs, Cooling Devices, Thermal management
    * Show CLIs
* Detection and Debugging
    * DPU Health
    * Alarms, Syslog
    * Console
* RMA
    * Inventory

The purpose of this document is to provide a framework to share the state, health, alarms of the DPUs, manage the DPUs by providing support to monitor, gracefully shutdown, restart them and the associated peripherals such as thermal sensors, cooling devices, LEDs, etc.

The picture below highlights the PMON vertical and its association with other logics within the SONiC architecture.

## 2.	Requirements and Assumptions

### 2.1.    Onboarding
* The SmartSwitch host PMON should be able to Startup, Shutdown, Restart, and Soft Reboot the entire system or the individual DPUs. The DPU_MODULE will behave like the LINE_CARD_MODULE of a modular chassis with respect to these functions.

### SmartSwitch Power up/down sequence:
* When the smartswitch device is booted, the host will boot first and leave the DPUs down by default.
* This section describes the cold startup, shutdown, restart and soft reboot. 

### Cold Startup
#### Definition
* The device is initially powered down.  Turn on the power and the device boots into its default state. The Switch and all the DPUs will be up or down depending on the configuration
* Switch: Turning on the power will boot the switch and be ready for traffic
* DPU: Turning on the power to the DPU will boot and be ready for traffic
#### Trigger
* Switch: Power on switch.
* DPU: Bootup configuration
#### Use case
* Switch: Day0 setup, Maintenance, RMA
* DPU: Day0, Day1-N Provisioning, Maintenance, RMA
#### DPU cold startup Sequence
* The chassis is powered up and the host is booting up.
* The switch PMON is registered with the configDB state change handler.
* If the DPU's "admin_status: down" in the configDB, the DPU will remain powered down. The default setting is "down".
* The switch PMON gets the admin up notification from the configDB
* The switch PMON invokes the platform API to power on the DPU
* DPU boots up and attaches itself to the midplane.
* Once SONiC is up, the state progression is updated for every state transition on the DPU_STATE table in the chassisStateDB

### DPU startup sequence diagram
<p align="center"><img src="./images/dpu-startup-seq.svg"></p>

#### 2.1.1 DPUs in dark mode
* A smartswitch when configured to boot up with all the DPUs in it are powered down upon boot up is referred as DPUs in dark mode.
* In the dark mode the platform.json file shown in section "3.1.3" will not have the dictionary for the DPUS.
* The term dark mode is overloaded in some cases where the platform.json may have the dictionary but the config_db.json will have the admin_state of all DPU modules as "down".
* When platform.json has DPU information, but config DB doesn't have the DPU admin state configuration, the DPUs should be in downstate.
* Default mode on smartswitch is dark mode, unless platform.json configures it to be in light up mode.
* The DPUs would stay power down in dark mode and will not consume power.

#### 2.1.2 Configuring startup and shutdown
* The user can use the “config chassis modules startup DPUx”  to power ON a DPU. Example: “config chassis modules startup DPU0”
* The “config chassis modules shutdown DPUx” is used to power OFF a DPU. Example: “config chassis modules shutdown DPU0”
* The DPUs are powered down by configuring the admin_status as shown in the schema
* The config change event handler running on the chassisd of PMON listens to the config change and sets the corresponding switch configDB table and also triggers the module set_admin_state() API.
* The platform executes the power ON/OFF sequence

#### config_db.json
CHASSIS_MODULE table holds the list and configuration of DPU modules in a smartswitch chassis. It allows user to administratively bring down a DPU. The following example assumes four DPUs in the system. Unlike the existing modular chassis configuration in a SmartSwitch a DPU module has to be explicitly configured to be "up", otherwise it be configured in the DB to be down as shown in the example.  The example assumes four DPUs in the system.
```
{
    "CHASSIS_MODULE": {
        "DPU0": {
            "admin_status": "down"
        },
        "DPU1": {
            "admin_status": "up"
        }
    }
    Note: There is no config for DPU2, DPU3 and the default is "down" as shown below
}
```
#### switch configDB
```
Key: "CHASSIS_MODULE|DPU0"
    "CHASSIS_MODULE|DPU0": {
        "value": {
            "admin_status":"down"
        }
    },
    "CHASSIS_MODULE|DPU1": {
        "value": {
            "admin_status":"up"
        }
    },
    "CHASSIS_MODULE|DPU2": {
        "value": {
            "admin_status":"down"
        }
    },
    "CHASSIS_MODULE|DPU3": {
        "value": {
            "admin_status":"down"
        }
    }
```

### Shutdown
#### Definition
* The device will be in powered up state.  Gracefully shutdown and tun off the power
* Switch: Gracefully shutdown all DPU SONiC turn off DPU power. Gracefully shutdown Switch SONiC and tun off the power to the switch
* DPU: Gracefully shutdown SONiC and turn off power
#### Trigger
* Switch: Turn off the power to the switch
* DPU: Configuration or CLI
#### Use case
* Switch: Maintenance, Critical alarm, RMA
* DPU: Maintenance, Critical alarm, Service migration, RMA
#### DPU shutdown sequence
* There could be two possible sources for DPU shutdown. 1. A configuration change to DPU "admin_status: down" 2. The GNOI logic can trigger it.
* The GNOI server runs on the DPU even after the DPU is pre-shutdown and listens until the graceful shutdown finishes.
* The host sends a GNOI signal to shutdown the DPU. The DPU does a graceful-shutdown if not already done and sends an ack back to the host.
* Upon receiving the ack or on a timeout the host may trigger the switch PMON vendor API to shutdown the DPU.
* If a vendor specific API is not defined, detachment is done via sysfs (echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/XXXX:XX:XX.X/remove).
* NPU-DPU (GNOI) soft reboot workflow is captured in [reboot-hld.md](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/26f3f4e282f3d2bd4a5c684608897850354f5c30/doc/smart-switch/reboot/reboot-hld.md)
* In the first option the "admin_status: down" configDB status change event will send a message to the switch PMON.
* The switch PMON will invoke the module class API "set_admin_state(self, up):" with the state being "down" and the platform in turn will call its API to gracefully shutdown the DPU.  
* The DPU upon receiving the shutdown message will do a graceful shutdown and send an ack back. The DPU graceful shutdown is vendor specific. The DPU power will be turned off after the graceful shutdown. In case of timeout the platform will force power down.
* The switch upon receiving the ack or on a timeout will remove the DPU from the bridge and PCIe tree.
### DPU shutdown sequence diagram
<p align="center"><img src="./images/dpu-shutdown-seq.svg"></p>

### Restart
#### Definition
* The device will be in powered up state.  Gracefully shutdown and tun off the power. Then turn on the power and the system will boot up
* Switch: Not Applicable (This can be done in two steps Shutdown + Cold Startup)
* DPU: Gracefully shutdown SONiC and turn off power to DPU and then power on DPU
#### Trigger
* Switch: Not Applicable
* DPU: Configuration or CLI using platform API (off followed by on)
#### Use case
* Switch: Maintenance
* DPU: Maintenance, Service migration

### Soft Reboot 
#### NPU-DPU (GNOI) soft reboot workflow will be captured in another document “SmartSwitch-Reboot-Design.md”.  Referred here for the sake of completeness.
#### Definition
* Gracefully restart SONiC without turning off the power. 
* Switch: Gracefully restart SONiC on switch and the DPUs that are up
* DPU: Gracefully restart SONiC on DPU
#### Trigger
* Switch: “reboot” command issued on switch console.
* DPU: “reboot” command issued to the DPU or Switch Software issues GNOI
#### Use case
* Switch: Fault recovery, Maintenance, debug
* DPU: Fault recovery, Maintenance, debug, Service provisioning

#### Onboarding requirements
* The DPU must provide additional control-plane and data-plane state information, timestamp, etc to DPU_STATE table as explained in the DPU_STATE schema once booted up.
* When the DPU reboots itself, should log the reboot cause and update the previous-reboot-cause field in the stateDB and persist in on the Switch.
* The reboot-cause history on the switch should provide a holistic view of the reboot cause of the SmartSwitch host CPU, and the reboot-cause of all the DPUs
* The DPUs should be uniquely identified and the DPU upon boot may get this ID from the host and identify itself.
* Implement the required API enhancements and new APIs for DPU management (see details in design section)
* SmartSwitch should use the existing SONiC midplane-interface model in modular chassis design for communication between the DPU and the NPU/Switch
* SmartSwitch should extend the SONiC modular chassis design and treat the dpu-cards just like line-cards in existing design
* Reboot
    * Only cold reboot of DPUs is required, warm boot support is not required.

### 2.2. Monitoring and Thermal Management
* Dpu State
    * The DPUs should provide their state to the host by updating the dpu state data in the DPU_STATE table in the host ChassisStateDB (explained in DB schema). This holds the minimal, viable set of low latency dpu state data and can be consumed by HA, LB, FaultManagement logics.
    * DPUs should be able to store the data using a redis call directly on to the switch chassisStateDB
    * The DPU must provide the state information once it boots its OS to DPU_STATE table.
    * The chassisd on the NPU-PMON will update the dpu_midplane_link_state, dpu_midplane_link_time, dpu_midplane_link_reason fields whenever there is a dpu_midplane_link_state transition.

* Thermal management
    * Besides additional DPU specific sensors, cooling device changes the logic remains the same.
    * Sensor values, fan speeds and fan status should be read periodically and stored in SmartSwitch StateDB
    * Platform modules should use the thermal sensor values against the thresholds in the thermal policy and adjust fan speeds depending on the temperature
    * Trigger thermal shut down on critical policy violation

* Show CLIs
    * Extend existing CLIs such as 'show platform fan/temperature' to support the new HW
    * Extend the modular chassis CLI 'show chassis modules status" to display the detailed DPU states. (See CLIs section)
    * The data for the CLIs come either from the DBs or through the platform APIs. Example: The DPU_STATE data are stored in the ChassisStateDB directly using a redis call and the CLIs access them from the DB. It is upto to the platform implementation on how do they fetch the DPU inventory and health data and store them on the host. For the sake of consistency and efficiency we recommend using the redis call and storing them in the chassisStateDB on the host.

### 2.3. Detect and Debug
* Health
    * SmartSwitch DPUs should store their health data locally and also provide it to the host for a consolidated view of the CLIs
    * DPUs should support a CLI to display the health data “show system-health ...” (See CLIs section)
    * The host pmon should use this data to support the host side CLIs. Though accessing this data from DPUs and storing them on the switch is implementation specific it is recommended to use redis call and store them on the switch chassisStateDB for faster access.
    * This is done in two phases. Please refer to section:3.1.5.1 for the HEALTH_INFO schema
    * use "UserDefinedChecker" class to provide this data to the CLIs.
    * Vendor specific data such as interrupt events can also be placed in user defined fields under this DB
    * This table already exists in modular chassis design and the DPUs will use this just like a line card.
* Alarm and Syslog
    * Raise alarms when the temperature thresholds exceed, fans run slow or not present or faulty
    * Drive LEDs accordingly
    * Provide LED status indicators for DPU boards
    * Trigger syslog
    * There is no new alarm or syslog required.  The existing ones are good.
* Console
    * Provide console access to the DPUs through the Host CPU from the front panel management port
    * The modular chassis console utility will be extended to access DPUs in place of LCs
### 2.3. RMA
* The DPUs should be displayed as part of inventory
* Extend the platform specific CLIs such as “show platform inventory” to display the DPUs
* The inventory data comes from the chassisStateDB.
* The system should be powered down for replacement of dpu-card

### 3.1. Platform monitoring and management
* SmartSwitch design Extends the existing chassis_base class and module_base class as described below.

#### 3.1.1 ChassisBase class API enhancements
is_modular_chassis(self):
```
    Retrieves whether the sonic instance is part of modular chassis. For SmartSwitch platforms this should return True even if they are
    fixed-platforms, as they are treated like a modular chassis as the DPU cards are treated like line-cards of a modular-chassis.

    Returns:
      False
```

get_num_modules(self):
```
    Retrieves the number of modules available on this chassis including DPUs.
    This is an existing API.

```
#### 3.1.5 ModuleBase class new APIs

##### 3.1.5.1 Need for consistent storage and access of DPU reboot cause, state and health
#### 1 Reboot Cause
The smartswitch needs to know the reboot cause for the NPU and the DPUs.

#### NPU Reboot Cause
* When the NPU undergoes a reboot the existing reboot-cause workflow for a switch still remains the same for a smartswitch as well.
* When the NPU reboots the "determine_reboot_cause" fetches the npu reboot-cause and persists the files in "/host/reboot-cause" path.
* A maximum of ten reboot-cause history entries per dpu will be persisted just like the npu.
* The "update_reboot_cause" function updates the stateDB with reboot-cause, time, user etc as shown in the schema.
* The existing "show reboot-cause" and "show reboot-cause history" CLIs will be backward compatible. Please refer to the CLI section.

#### Schema for REBOOT_CAUSE of SWITCH on switch stateDB
```
  Key: "REBOOT_CAUSE|2023_06_18_14_56_12"

  "REBOOT_CAUSE|2023_06_18_14_56_12": {
    "value": {
      "cause": "Unknown",
      "comment": "N/A",
      "time": "2023_06_18_14_56_12",
      "user": "N/A"
    }
  }

```
#### DPU Reboot Cause
* The smartswitch needs to know the reboot cause for all the DPUs.
* The NPU hardware should be capable of providing the DPU reboot-cause even when the DPUs are dead.
* The get_reboot_cause will return the current reboot-cause of the module.
* For persistent storage of the DPU reboot-cause and reboot-cause-history files use the existing mechanism and host storage path under "/host/reboot-cause/module/dpux".
* The storage and retrieval of the reboot-cause of the Switch and PDUs are shown in the sequence diagram

<p align="center"><img src="./images/dpu-reboot-seq.svg"></p>

#### Reboot workflow
* The switch boots up. Determines the NPU reboot cause. 
* Processes the previously stored NPU and DPU reboot-cause files and history files.
* A maximum of ten reboot-cause history entries per dpu will be persisted just like the npu.
* Updates the NPU reboot-cause into the StateDB and the DPU reboot-cause into the ChassisStateDB.
* The above process is a one-shot event on boot up.
* The module_db_update function in the NPU-PMON chassisd is an existing function constantly updating the operational status of the DPUs.
* This function looks for DPU operational status change events and when the DPUs come out of "offline" state, issues "get_reboot_cause" API to the platform.
* The dpu operational state transition from 'offline' to 'online' guarantees the reboot of a DPU.
* The platform code will extract the DPU reboot cause from the NPU hardware itself even when the DPU is not reachable.
* The DPU reboot cause will be mapped to one of the following existing reboot causes and returned back.
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_POWER_LOSS = "Power Loss"
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_THERMAL_OVERLOAD_CPU = "Thermal Overload: CPU"
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_THERMAL_OVERLOAD_ASIC = "Thermal Overload: ASIC"
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_THERMAL_OVERLOAD_OTHER = "Thermal Overload: Other"
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_INSUFFICIENT_FAN_SPEED = "Insufficient Fan Speed"
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_WATCHDOG = "Watchdog"
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_HARDWARE_OTHER = "Hardware - Other"
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_HARDWARE_BIOS = "BIOS"
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_HARDWARE_CPU = "CPU"
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_HARDWARE_BUTTON = "Push button"
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_HARDWARE_RESET_FROM_ASIC = "Reset from ASIC"
    * REBOOT_CAUSE_NON_HARDWARE = "Non-Hardware"
* When the platform wants to provide additional details to the reboot cause they can append it to the string with a ',' separation as shown below.
```
return REBOOT_CAUSE_NON_HARDWARE + ', ' + 'kernel panic'
```
* The switch reboot use case will follow the same sequence.
* The pmon container restart should not affect this sequence as the states are persisted either in the DB or in the file system.

#### Schema for REBOOT_CAUSE of DPUs on switch ChassisStateDB
```
  Key: "REBOOT_CAUSE|DPU0|2024_06_06_09_31_18"

  "REBOOT_CAUSE|DPU0|2024_06_06_09_31_18": {
    "value": {
      "cause": "Software causes (Reboot)",
      "comment": "User issued 'reboot' command [User: admin, Time: Thu Jun  6 09:46:43 AM UTC 2024]",
      "device": "DPU0",
      "time": "N/A",
      "user": "N/A"
    }
  }

```
#### 2. DPU State
    * Added supporting fileds such as "time" and "reason" to show exactly where in the state progression the DPU failed. This will be helpful in fault isolation, DPU switchover decision, resiliency and recovery
    * Though this is platform implementation specific, in a multi vendor use case, there has to be a consistent way of storing and accessing the information.
    * Store the state progression (dpu_midplane_link_state, dpu_control_plane_state, dpu_data_plane_state) on the host ChassisStateDB.
    * get_state_info(self) will return an object with the ChassisStateDB data
    * Two more APIs get_dataplane_state(self) and get_controlplane_state(self) are available to get the dataplane_state and controlplane_state are available to access them individually.
    * The dpu_midplane_link_state will be monitored and updated by the NPU PMON chassisd.
    * Potential consumers: HA, LB, Switch CLIs, Utils (install/repair images), Life Cycle Manager 
    * Use cases: HA, Debuggability, error recovery (reset, power cycle) and fault management, consolidated view of Switch and DPU state

#### DPU_STATE definition
dpu_midplane_link_state: up refers to the pcie link between the NPU and DPU is operational. This will be updated by the switch pcied.

dpu_control_plane_state: up  refers to DPU SONIC booted up, all the containers are up, the interfaces are up and dpu is ready to take SDN policy update

dpu_data_plane_state: up  refers to configuration downloaded, the pipeline stages are up and DPU hardware (port/ASIC) is ready to take traffic

#### 3 DPU Health
This feature is implemented in two phases.
#### Phase:1
* Each DPU has to store the health info locally and should be available on the DPU when the "show system-health ..." CLI is executed on the DPU just like the switch.
#### Phase:2
* Each DPU besides storing the health info locally, should also store the DPU health info in the switch ChassisStateDB. The schema for each DPU health info is the same as the switch and also is shown below.
* When the "show system-health <all/DPUx/SWITCH>" CLI is executed on the switch a consolidated view of the entire system health will be provided.
* The DPU is a complex hardware. To facilitate debug, a consistent way of storing and accessing the health record of the DPUs is critical in a multi vendor scenario even though it is a platform specific implementation.
* Both switch and the DPUs will follow the [SONiC system health monitor HLD](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/ce313db92a694e007a6c5332ce3267ac158290f6/doc/system_health_monitoring/system-health-HLD.md)
* Refer to section 3.4.5 for "show system-health .." CLIs

#### Schema for HEALTH_INFO of DPUs on switch ChassisStateDB
```
; Defines information for a system health
key                     = SYSTEM_HEALTH_INFO|DPUx        ; health information for DPUx
; field                 = value
summary                 = STRING                         ; summary status for the DPU
<item_name>             = STRING                         ; an entry for a service or device

```
We store items to db only if it is abnormal. Here is an example:
```
admin@sonic:~$ redis-cli -n 13 hgetall SYSTEM_HEALTH_INFO
1) "lldp:lldpmgrd"
2) "Process 'lldpmgrd' in container 'lldp' is not running"
3) "summary"
4) "Not OK"
```
If the system status is good, the data in redis is like:
```
admin@sonic:~$ redis-cli -n 13 hgetall SYSTEM_HEALTH_INFO
 1) "summary"
 2) "OK"
```
##### 3.1.5.2 ModuleBase class new APIs
The DPU ID is used only for indexing purpose.

get_dpu_id(self):
```
    Retrieves the DPU ID. Returns None for non-smartswitch chassis.

    Returns:
        An integer, indicating the DPU ID. DPU0 returns 0, DPUX returns X
```
#### Get DPU reboot cause
def get_reboot_cause(self):
```
        Retrieves the cause of the previous reboot of the DPU module

        Returns:
            A tuple (string, string) where the first element is a string containing the cause of the previous reboot. This string must be one of the predefined strings in this class. If the first string is "REBOOT_CAUSE_HARDWARE_OTHER", the second string can be used to pass a description of the reboot cause.
```

#### DPU_STATE Use Case
* This API can be be used by High Availability, Load Balancing, Debug, error recovery (reset, power cycle) and fault management logics. The exact HA use case will be updated in the HA document.

get_state_info(self):
```
    Retrieves the DPU_STATE table from the switch ChassisStateDB

    Returns:
        An object instance of the DPU_STATE (see DB schema)
        Returns None on DPU module
```

#### DPU_HEALTH Use Case
* The major consumer of this data could be CLIs, fault management, debug, error recovery.  There is no platform API for this.

### 3.2 Thermal management
* Platform  initializes all sensors
* Thermalctld fetch CPU temperature, DPU temperature, fan speed, monitor and update the DB
* The thermal management runs on NPU
* Thermal manager reads all thermal sensor data, run thermal policy and take policy action Ex. Set fan speed, set alarm, set syslog, set LEDs 
* Platform collects fan related data such as presence, failure and then applies fan algorithm to set the new fan speed
* The north bound CLI/Utils/App use DB data to ”show environment”, ”show platform temp” show platform fan”
* The existing "TEMPERATURE_INFO" schema will be used to store the values and is shown below for convenience.

#### TEMPERATURE_INFO schema in StateDB
```
  "TEMPERATURE_INFO|DPU_0_T": {
    "value": {
      "critical_high_threshold": "105.0",
      "critical_low_threshold": "-10.0",
      "high_threshold": "100.0",
      "is_replaceable": "False",
      "low_threshold": "-5.0",
      "maximum_temperature": "38.938",
      "minimum_temperature": "18.188",
      "temperature": "33.375",
      "timestamp": "20230624 15:50:15",
      "warning_status": "False"
    }
  }
```
Thermal management sequence diagram
<p align="center"><img src="./images/thermal-mgmt-seq.svg"></p>

#### 3.2.1 Platform device data collection 
* thermalctld, led and PSUd post device data to DB periodically
* during the boot up of the daemons, it will collect the constant data like serial number, manufacture name, etc.
* For the variable ones (temperature, voltage, fan speed ....) need to be collected periodically. 

### 3.3   Midplane Interface
A typical modular chassis includes a midplane-interface to interconnect the Supervisor & line-cards. When DPU card or the Switch boots and as part of its initialization, midplane interface gets initialized.
* By default smartswitch midplane IP address assignment will be done using internal DHCP.
* Please refer to the [ip-address-assignment document](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/smart-switch/ip-address-assigment/smart-switch-ip-address-assignment.md) for IP address assignment between the switch host and the DPUs.
* The second option is the static IP address assignment.
* A DPU state change handler will be implemented to monitor PCIe link state change events, DPU control-plane and data-plane state transitions mainly for HA.
* There will be a separate hld for the DPU state change handler.

### 3.4 Debug & RMA
CLI Extensions and Additions

#### Platform CLIs
* Platform CLIs remain the same but include DPU, and changes in sensors and FRUs. The "show platform inventory" is an example to display the DPU modules.

show platform inventory 
* shows the DPUs on the switch          <font>**`Executed on the switch. This CLI is not available on the DPU`**</font>

#### 3.4.1 Reboot Cause CLIs
* There are two existing CLIs "show reboot-cause" and "show reboot-cause history"
* These two CLIs are extended to "show reboot-cause all" and "show reboot-cause history \<option\>", where the "option" could be DPUx, all or SWITCH
* The DPUs will limit the number of history entries to a maximum of ten.
* The recent reboot-cause can be derived from that list of reboot-causes.
* Platform hardware should have the DPU reboot-cause available on the NPU side and provided it to the "get_reboot_cause()" API

#### 3.4.2 Reboot Cause CLIs on the DPUs      <font>**`Executed on the DPU`**</font>
* The "show reboot-cause" shows the most recent reboot-cause
* The "show reboot-cause history" shows the reboot-cause history
* The new cli extensions will not have any effect on the DPUs as shown in the example.

#### 3.4.5  System health details
#### Phase:1
* The system health summary on switch will display only the NPU health
* The system health summary on DPU will display the DPU health

#### Phase:2
* The system health summary on switch should include the NPU and DPU health. Extend the existing CLI infrastructure.

show system-health summary \<module-name\>   <font>**`Executed on the switch or DPU - module-name is ignored on the DPUs`**</font>

* The "show system-health ..." is extended to include the DPU_STATE detail.
show system-health DPU \<dpu-index\>  <font>**`Executed on the switch. This CLI is not available on the DPU.`**</font>
```
When the idex is "all" shows the detailed state of all DPUs

Oper-Status definition: 
Online : All states are up
Offline: dpu_midplane_link_state is down
Fault: dpu_midplane_link_state is up and dpu_control_plane_state or dpu_data_plane_state is down

There are two parts to the state detail. 1. The midplane state 2. the dpu states (control plane state, data plane state). The midplane state has to be updated by the switch side pcied. The dpu states will be updated by the DPU (redis client update) on the switch ChassisStateDB. The get_state_info() API in the moduleBase class will fetch the contents from the DB. The show CLI reads the redis table and displays the data.

#### System health cli extended further as shown
 * Detailed output from the switch can be obtained with the following CLI
 * The system-health monitor-list command should include the status of the DPU. If one or more DPUs are not ok it should be highlighted in the command output
 * The switch will fetch the DPU information from the DPUs

show system-health monitor-list \<module-name\>  <font>**`Executed on the switch or DPU - module-name is ignored on the DPUs`**</font>
```
The module-name can be DPU0, ... DPUX, SWITCH, all
When module-name is "all" the CLI output shows both SWITCH and DPUs

### 3.5 Console Management
The console access to smartswitch needs to support DPU access in addition to the switch.
* By default the management port should be connected to the switch CPU console
* Once inside the switch, the DPUs should be accesssible from it.

#### 3.5.1 Dpu Console Utility
* Sonic now supports a DPU console utility "dpu-tty.py"
* The scope of this is limited only to smartswitch paltforms
* The user can invoke one or more DPU consoles as shown below by invoking the script "dpu-tty.py" with the module name option "-n dpu0"

```
root@MtFuji:/home/cisco# dpu-tty.py -n dpu0
picocom v3.1

port is        : /dev/ttyS4
flowcontrol    : none
baudrate is    : 115200

stopbits are   : 1
escape is      : C-a
local echo is  : no
noinit is      : no
noreset is     : no

```
#### 3.5.2 Dpu Console Configuration
* The console configuration is provided via the platform.json file as shown
* This file is responsible for selecting the baud rate and mapping the module name to the underlying TTY device name.
```
Sample platform.json configuration

"DPUS": {
    "dpu0": {
        "serial-console": {
            "device": "ttyS4",
            "baud-rate": "115200"
        }
    },
    "dpu1": {
        "serial-console": {
            "device": "ttyS5",
            "baud-rate": "115200"
        }
    }
},
```

### 3.6 Firmware Upgrade
* The fwutility should remain unchanged, but the vendor plugin should be extended to support the DPU FW upgrade.
* Should support the following commands
    * show: display FW versions
    * install: manual FW installation
    * update: automatic FW installation
```
Example:

|--- show
|    |--- version
|    |--- status
|    |--- updates -i|--image=<current|next>
|    |--- updates -z|--fw-image=<fw_package.tar.gz>
|    |--- update status
|
|--- install
|    |--- chassis
|    |    |--- component <component_name>
|    |         |--- fw -y|--yes <fw_path>
|    |
|    |--- module <module_name>
|         |--- component <component_name>
|              |--- fw -y|--yes <fw_path>
|
|--- update
     |--- chassis
     |    |--- component <component_name>
     |         |--- fw -y|--yes -f|--force -i|--image=<current|next>
     |
     |--- module <module_name>
     |    |--- component <component_name>
     |         |--- fw -y|--yes -f|--force -i|--image=<current|next>
     |--- all
          |--- fw -i|--image=<current|next> --b|--boot=<none|fast|warm|cold>
          |--- fw -z|--fw-image=<fw_package.tar.gz> --b|--boot=<none|fast|warm|cold>

Note:
    <fw_path> can be absolute path or URL
    --image and --fw-image cannot be supported at the same time
    Progress of FPD operation and any failures would be displayed on the console with appropriate levels of severity
```
