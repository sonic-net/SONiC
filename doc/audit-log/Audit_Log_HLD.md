# About this Manual
This document provides general information about the Audit Log feature implementation in SONiC.
# Scope
This document describes the high level design of Audit Log feature. 

# 1 Feature Overview

Audit log provides a way to monitor several security relevant information on the system with an insight on security health of the system.

## 1.1 Requirements

- The log messages will be stored as a separate file under /var/log on the switch itself and will follow similar format to syslog messages. Support for local and remote logging will be enabled by default.

- The audit log should contain the following messages:
  1. Log messages corresponding to login and logout through SSH and Console. The message content & format is from open source modules and is fixed.
  2. Log messages corresponding to when user tries config & show command via KLISH, gNMI and REST.  The command message will not have command hierarchy information.

  Audit log result for REST & gNMI will be in simple flat list; message will not be in key/value format.

- Log rotate is used to enforce size as 10M for audit log and goes through four rotations before being removed.

- Audit log files should be included in tech-support bundle.

### 1.1.2 Configuration and Management Requirements
- There need to be a show command to display the contents of audit log.
   1. show audit-log all - lists all messages from audit.log and rotated, uncompressed audit logs - namely, audit.log.1.
      The command will not attempt to display compressed and rotated audit log files.

      The *all* filter will fetch all audit log messages and potentially have performance implications and high response time.

   2. show audit-log     - lists recent 20 messages from audit.log

- There need to be a clear command to clear contents of audit logs.

## 1.2 Design Overview
### 1.2.1 Basic Approach
The feature implements the framework for audit log. As of now, the audit log comprises of messages corresponding to 
* login and logout related events through SSH and console 
* requests from north bound interfaces: CLI, REST and gNMI

Syslog rules are used to filter out these messages and populate audit log.

The login linux package is updated to trigger syslog message for login through console.

Any subsequent requirements to add new audit messages need to add a new syslog rule or augment existing syslog rules 
as mentioned in this [section](#311-syslog-rules)

# 2 Functionality
## 2.1 Target Deployment Use Cases
Audit Log collects certain types of system activity to facilitate incident investigation. The system activities includes
login/logout events through ssh/console. The other correpsonds to requests from north bound interfaces - CLI, REST and gNMI.

# 3 Design
## 3.1 Overview
Specified audit messages are stored in /var/log/audit.log.

Syslog rules with the help of various syslog properties like *syslogtag*, *syslogfacility*, *programname* are used to filter
these messages and redirect them to /var/log/audit.log.

SSHD triggers messages for login and logout through ssh. For login and logout through console, linux login package need to be
modified to trigger a syslog message.

Log rotate would manage audit log with size restrictions of 1M. 

### 3.1.1 Syslog Rules
SSHD generates successful login/logout messages with *authpriv* facility. Messages corresponding to invalid credentials triggered
with *auth* facility.

```
if $syslogtag contains 'sshd' then {
   if $syslogfacility-text == 'authpriv' then {
       action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/audit.log")
   }
   if $syslogfacility-text == 'auth' then {
       action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/audit.log")
   }
}
```
Management framework log messages are sent with *local4* facility.
```
if $syslogfacility-text == 'local4' then {
    action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/audit.log")
}
```
Some of the console login/logout messages comes through *systemd*.
```
if $programname == 'systemd' then {
    action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/audit.log")
}
```

The login linux package triggers messages corresponding to successful and failed login attempts with *programname* as **login**.
```
if $programname == 'login' then {
    action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/audit.log")
}
```

### 3.1.2 Linux login package
This package is modified to trigger a syslog message after user logs in. The build system is updated to build login target.

### 3.1.3 Commands
'show audit-log' displays contents of audit.log and audit.log.1. 
By default the command displays a brief snapshot of audit log by displaying around latest twenty messages.
With *all* option, all of the audit.log and audit.log.1 is displayed.

Through REST, the path is /restconf/operations/sonic-auditlog:get-auditlog
For gNMI, the path is sonic-auditlog:get-auditlog

```
sonic# show audit-log
  <all>  Display all of audit log
  |      Pipe through a command
  <cr>
```
Through REST, the path is /restconf/operations/sonic-auditlog:clear-auditlog
For gNMI, the path is /sonic-auditlog:clear-auditlog

```
sonic# clear audit-log
  <cr>

```

### 3.1.4 Log rotate
Log rotate is configured to enforce size limitation of 10M for audit log. There will be four rotations. Rsyslog will be restated
after each rotation.

### 3.1.5 show tech-support
The existing show tech-support already packages all the files under /var/log into tech-support package.

Currently, the following log files from /var/log are packaged with tech support:
audit.log, auth.log, cron.log, daemon.log, messages, syslog, stpd.log, teamd.log, telemetry.log, udldd.log, user.log and zebra.log

## 3.2 User Interface
### 3.2.1 Data Models
```
module sonic-auditlog {
    namespace "http://github.com/Azure/sonic-auditlog";
    prefix auditlog;
    yang-version 1.1;

    organization
        "SONiC";

    contact
        "SONiC";

    description
        "SONiC yang for RPC based audit log operations.";

    revision 2020-05-29 {
        description
            "Initial revision.";
    }

    rpc get-auditlog {
       description "RPC for getting audit log.";

       input {
           leaf content-type {
               type string {
                   pattern "all";
               }
               description "Indicates if user wants to get all or latest twenty lines of audit log";
           }
       }

       output {
           list audit-content {
               leaf content {
                   type string;
                   description "Audit message";
               }
           }
       }
    }

    rpc clear-auditlog {
       description "RPC for clearing audit log.";
    }
}

```
### 3.2.2 CLI
#### 3.2.2.1 Clear Commands
Clearing audit log is implemented as RPC and is achieved with the help of HostQuery module - clearaudit.py. 
On receiving the request from container, this module will remove audit.log and restarts rsyslog.

```
sonic# clear audit-log
sonic#
```

#### 3.2.2.2 Show Commands
To display contents of audit log, show command is implemented and it is RPC.
To achieve better performance, audit log is mounted onto mgmt-framework container.
The command by default displays a brief snapshot of audit log by showing last twenty lines.
The command has an 'all' option to display all of the audit.log and audit.log.1.

```
sonic# show audit-log
  <all>  Display all of audit log
  |      Pipe through a command
  <cr>
```

### 3.2.3 REST API Support
#### 3.2.3.1 Show Audit Log 
Path: /restconf/operations/sonic-auditlog:get-auditlog

Input: "all" or none

#### 3.2.3.2 Clear Audit Log 
Path: /restconf/operations/sonic-auditlog:clear-auditlog

### 3.2.4 GNMI API Support
#### 3.2.4.1 Show Audit Log 
Path: /sonic-auditlog:get-auditlog

Input: "all" or none

#### 3.2.4.2 Clear Audit Log
