## Requirement Overview
### Overview
SONiC uses ICMP echo request and reply packets to monitor state of links between server blades and the ToR switches in DualTor architecture. When link state change is detected, SONiC switches the traffic by reprogramming the routes. Currently SONiC uses software based generation and reception of ICMP packets that passes over the Host OS network stack. This limits the intervals at which ICMP packets can be transmitted and received and hence the link state detection time. ICMP hardware offload addresses this limitation.

ICMP Hardware offload overcomes this limitation using the NPU hardware in the ToR switches to transmit and receive the ICMP packets and monitor the ICMP sessions for link state. This hardware based monitoring reduces the link state detection time.

Following diagram shows the cluster topology of Dual-ToR architecture for reference. Both ToRs use same loopback IP address as source IP in the ICMP echo packets.
<div align="center"> <img src=image/cluster_topology.png width=600 /> </div>

### Requirement
Current link state detection time with software based ICMP sessions is in the order of 200-400 milliseconds. Requirement for ICMP Hardware Offload is to bring this down to < 10 milliseconds.


### High Level Components and Requirements
#### LinkMgrd Requirements
LinkMgrd is the central component that runs in MUX docker and is responsible for managing ICMP echo sessions and link state. Link prober sub-component in Linkmgrd is responsible for the ICMP echo sessions.
* Requirements
   * Add / Remove Hardware ICMP echo session in App DB based on mux cable and link prober config entries.
   * Consume ICMP echo session state from State DB produced by Orchagent and update mux state.
   * Create two hardware sessions per mux port / interface one for self and another one to monitor the peer replies.
   * Generate and handle ICMP packets with TLVs in software.
   * Support dual timer configuration (self_interval and peer_interval) for asymmetric timing control.
   * Eliminate deadline timer for hardware prober due to low timer values which would otherwise wake up the thread unnecessarily too often, improving overall performance.
   * Maintain hybrid processing with hardware offload for regular ICMP packets and software processing for TLV packets.

Following diagram shows the hardware ICMP echo sessions between the TORs and Server.

#### Orchagent Requirements
A new IcmpOrch is added to support ICMP hardware offload sessions.
* IcmpOrch Requirements
   * Support hardware offload sessions based on switch capability.
   * Create / Remove hardware ICMP echo sessions by consuming entries in App DB.
   * Consume ICMP echo session notification from SAI and update session state in State DB.

#### SaiRedis Requirements
A new SAI specification was added to support ICMP Echo offload sessions in SAI version 1.12.
* Requirements
  * Support all SAI attributes of sai icmp echo session from saiicmpecho.h.
  * Support SAI switch notification for sai icmp echo sessions.

### LinkMgrd
With introduction of ICMP hardware offload a new config knob **[prober_type]** is added to differentiate between software and hardware based link probing. When hardware prober is configued LinkMgrd will create the offload session based on capability of the platform. Hardware based Link Prober is added in LinkMgrd to support hardware based probing that produces the ICMP echo sessions entries in App DB ICMP_ECHO_SESSION_TABLE that gets consumed by orchagent. LinkMgrd will consume icmp echo session entries from State DB ICMP_ECHO_SESSION_TABLE to determine the hardware prober state and trigger events for Link state machines.

**Key LinkMgrd Changes for Hardware Offload:**

* **Dual Timer Support:** LinkMgrd now supports separate timer configurations (self_interval and peer_interval) that allow asymmetric timing for self-generated ICMP packets versus peer monitoring
* **Deadline Timer Elimination:** When operating in hardware mode, LinkMgrd eliminates the deadline timer mechanism due to the low timer values (3ms) which would otherwise cause excessive thread wake-ups, negatively impacting system performance
* **Hybrid Processing Model:** LinkMgrd maintains a hybrid approach where regular ICMP packets are offloaded to hardware while TLV packets are processed by a dedicated software thread
* **Enhanced Session Management:** LinkMgrd creates and manages both NORMAL sessions (for sending ICMP requests) and RX sessions (for monitoring peer responses) with different timer configurations
* **Hardware Capability Detection:** LinkMgrd detects platform hardware offload capabilities before creating hardware sessions, falling back to software mode if hardware support is unavailable

Following diagram describes ICMP packet format used in the hardware offload.

#### Session cookie
Session cookie is used by NPU to distinguish between software ICMP packets and ICMP packets that needs to be handled by the offload engine in NPU. LinkMgrd will use separate cookies for software and hardware based sessions.

#### Session GUID handling
Session GUID is used to distinguish between the ICMP sessions. However session GUID is not generated per session in the current implementation, yet it works as the software based probing uses raw Linux packet socket on the interface. This way software does not need to demultiplex icmp echo reply packets for each link's session based on session GUID. However in hardware based approach NPU uses the session GUID to map the icmp packets to a session. So with introduction of hardware probing session GUID will always be a randomly generated unique value for both software and hardware sessions.

To avoid collision of GUIDs between self and peer sessions, last byte of session GUID will be set to a fixed value unique to a ToR. ToR roles like Upper ToR and Lower ToR can be determined based on multiple factors and Linkmgrd can as well use some preset values based on these roles as the last byte of session GUID.

#### Peer session handling
Hardware Link prober needs to know the peer session GUID to set the peer session entry in App DB. For this the hardware link prober in LinkMgrd will listen / receive initially icmp echo reply packets from peer over the Linux packet socket on the interface, reusing the mechanism used in software link prober. It will learn the session GUID from the payload of these icmp echo reply packets from peer and use this learnt session GUID to create the hardware offload session entry for peer in App DB.

#### Timer considerations
* **Minimum timer value:** Minimum allowed timer value for software session will be set to 100 msec and for hardware session will be 3 msec.

* **Dual Timer Configuration:** With ICMP hardware offload, linkmgrd introduces two separate timer configurations:
    * **self_interval:** Timer value for ICMP echo requests sent by the local ToR to monitor its own link state
    * **peer_interval:** Timer value for monitoring ICMP echo replies received from the peer ToR
    * This dual timer approach allows for asymmetric timing configurations where self and peer monitoring can operate at different intervals based on network requirements

* **Deadline Timer Elimination:** When prober_type is set to "hardware", the traditional deadline timer mechanism in linkmgr is eliminated due to the low timer values (3ms minimum) which would otherwise cause the thread to wake up unnecessarily too often, leading to performance degradation. Hardware-based ICMP processing provides deterministic timing guarantees, making software-based deadline timers redundant.

* **TLV Packet Processing:** While regular ICMP packets are processed in hardware, TLV (Type-Length-Value) packets continue to be processed in software by a separate thread. This ensures that control plane messages embedded in TLV payloads are properly handled by linkmgrd even when hardware offload is enabled.

* **ICMP echo session tx_interval setting:**
    * tx_interval = probing_interval (no self_interval configured)
    * tx_interval = self_interval (probing_interval setting is overriden when self_interval is configured)
    * For peer monitoring sessions: tx_interval set to 0 (RX only mode)
    * Positive probing timer value = tx_interval x positive signal count.
    * LinkMgrd will start positive probing timer after receiving the first UP state notification for a session from State DB and link prober will continue to remain in unknown state until the expiry of this positive timer at which it will transition the Link prober to Active state.

* **ICMP echo session rx_interval setting:**
    * Self session rx_interval = probing_interval x negative signal count (when self_interval not configured)
    * Self session rx_interval = self_interval x negative signal count (when self_interval is configured)
    * Peer monitoring session: rx_interval = probing_interval x negative signal count (when peer_interval not configured)
    * Peer monitoring session: rx_interval = peer_interval x negative signal count (when peer_interval configured)
    * LinkMgrd will directly transition the link prober to unknown state avoiding the negative probing timer as opposed to what was done in case of software probing.

#### Link Prober State transitions
Following table shows the link prober state transitions based on event when link_prober mode is set as hardware and icmp echo session is offloaded to NPU.
<div align="center"> <img src=image/link_state_transition.png width=600 /> </div>

#### TLV generation considerations
ICMP packets with TLVs will not be generated by the hardware/NPU and LinkMgrd will generate these packets in software using the software cookie as currently done by software prober. Using the software cookie for TLV generation will make sure peer NPU will not consume these ICMP packets in hardware and LinkMgrd running on peer ToR will be able to receive and handle these TLV packets.

### Orchagent
#### IcmpOrch
IcmpOrch is a new component introduced which consumes icmp echo session entries from App DB ICMP_ECHO_SESSION_TABLE and programs the ICMP hardware offload sessions in NPU. It receives icmp echo session state notifications from SAI / NPU and produces session state in State DB ICMP_ECHO_SESSION_TABLE that is consumed by LinkMgrd.

Following diagram describes the component level flow for icmp state change notifications.
<div align="center"> <img src=image/icmp_session_state_notification.png width=600 /> </div>

* **Session Key format:**
Vrf-name : Interface Alias : Session GUID : Session Type
* Examples of session key format:
  * default:default:5000:NORMAL
  * default:default:6000:RX
  * default:Ethernet0:12000:NORMAL
* Session Type:
  * 'NORMAL': Install a normal icmp echo session that will transmit, receive icmp echo session packets and monitor the session.
  * 'RX': Install a monitor only icmp echo session and set the tx_interval to zero which will not send any icmp echo session.
* Interface Alias 'default' will set the SAI atttribute hw_lookup to true and NPU will perform forwarding lookup basd on dst_ip to determine the outgoing interface.

### DB Schema Changes

#### Config-DB
A new knob will be added in MUX_LINKMGR|LINK_PROBER to distinguish between hardware and software link prober:
  * **prober_type**
    * software : create software based icmp echo session. This is default value.
    * hardware : create hardware based icmp echo session.

Additionally, two new timer configuration fields are introduced in the MUX_CABLE table to support dual timer functionality:
  * **self_interval:** Timer interval in milliseconds for ICMP echo requests sent by the local ToR (default: 100ms for software, 3ms for hardware)
  * **peer_interval:** Timer interval in milliseconds for monitoring ICMP echo replies from peer ToR (default: 100ms for software, 3ms for hardware)
