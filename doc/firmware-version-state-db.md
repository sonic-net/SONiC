# 2 Scope

This HLD describes adding component firmware (FPD) version information into SONiC's STATE_DB during chassis initialization. 
The data will be written under a new COMPONENT_INFO table in STATE_DB, keyed by component name and storing a firmware-version field. 
This is a read-only population step performed by sonic-chassisd at chassis DB init.
