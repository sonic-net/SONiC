## Overview 

The support of SRv6 has been defined in this HLD: [Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) HLD](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/master/doc/srv6/srv6_hld.md).

The HLD includes several SRv6 behaviors defined in [RFC 8986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8986).
The Appl DB was extended to support these behaviors. 

The Appl DB includes the L3Adj attributes which is used with these behaviors: uA, End.X, uDX4, uDX6, End.DX4, and End.DX6.

The current implementation of SRv6Orch does not process the L3Adj.

In this HLD, we extend the SRv6Orch to process the L3Adj and program it in the ASIC DB.

## High-Level Design 

The following diagram shows the SRv6Orch workflow to process an SRv6 SID associated with a L3Adj in SONiC:
<br> <br>

![SRv6 SID L3Adj Sequence Diagram](images/srv6_sid_l3adj_sequence_diagram.png "SRv6 SID_L3Adj Sequence Diagram").

- SRv6Orch is an APPL_DB subscriber.
- SRv6Orch receives a `SRV6_MY_SID_TABLE` update notification about the SID. The SID is associated with a L3 adjacency carried in the `adj` parameter.
- SRv6Orch gets the nexthop ID of the adjacency from NeighOrch.
- SRv6Orch sets the nexthop ID attribute of the SID.
- SRv6Orch invokes the sairedis `sai_srv6_api->create_my_sid_entry()` API to create the SRv6 SID entry in the ASIC DB. 

The next subsections describe the SRv6Orch changes required to support the HLD described above.

### SRv6Orch Changes

We extend SRv6Orch to support the programming of the L3Adj associated with uA, End.X, uDX4, uDX6, End.DX4, and End.DX6 behaviors.

When SRv6Orch receives a SID with the `adj` parameter set, it calls the function `neighOrch->hasNextHop()` to make sure a nexthop associated with the adjacency exists.
- If the nexthop exists, SRv6Orch invokes the sairedis API `sai_srv6_api->create_my_sid_entry()` to create an entry `SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_MY_SID_ENTRY` into the ASIC DB. The `SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ATTR_NEXT_HOP_ID` of the entry is set to the nexthop ID.
- If the nexthop does not exist or is not ready, SRv6Orch keeps the SID in a new data structure called `m_pendingSRv6MySIDEntries`.

SRv6Orch subscribes to Neighbor Change notifications. When the neighbor becomes ready, SRv6Orch receives a Neighbor ADD notification, walks through the `m_pendingSRv6MySIDEntries` list and installs all pending SIDs into the ASIC.

We also handle the case when the neighbor associated with a SID is removed from the system. In this case, SRv6Orch receives a Neighbor DELETE notification, removes the SID from the ASIC and adds the SID to the `m_pendingSRv6MySIDEntries`. When the neighbor comes back, the SID is installed again into the ASIC.

## SAI API 

The `SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_MY_SID_ENTRY` object already supports the `SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ATTR_NEXT_HOP_ID` attribute required to associate a L3Adj to a SID.

```

/**
 * @brief Attribute list for My SID
 */
typedef enum _sai_my_sid_entry_attr_t
{

...
    /**
     * @brief Next hop for cross-connect functions
     *
     * @type sai_object_id_t
     * @flags CREATE_AND_SET
     * @objects SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_NEXT_HOP, SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_NEXT_HOP_GROUP, SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_ROUTER_INTERFACE
     * @allownull true
     * @default SAI_NULL_OBJECT_ID
     * @validonly SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ATTR_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR == SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR_X or SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ATTR_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR == SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR_DX4 or SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ATTR_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR == SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR_DX6 or SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ATTR_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR == SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR_B6_ENCAPS or SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ATTR_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR == SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR_B6_ENCAPS_RED or SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ATTR_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR == SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR_B6_INSERT or SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ATTR_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR == SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ENDPOINT_BEHAVIOR_B6_INSERT_RED
     */
    SAI_MY_SID_ENTRY_ATTR_NEXT_HOP_ID,
...

} sai_my_sid_entry_attr_t;
```

There is no SAI modification required to support the L3Adj parameter.

		
## Testing Requirements/Design  

### Unit Test cases  

To validate the SRv6 SID L3Adj parameter, we extend the existing `test_mysid` test cases contained in the `test_srv6.py` unit test. We create a new SRv6 SID entry associated with a L3 adjacency into the `SRV6_MY_SID_TABLE` of the Appl DB and we verify that the SID entry is created into the ASIC DB. This test is performed for all the behaviors that require a L3 adjacency: uA, End.X, End.DX4, End.DX6, uDX4, uDX6.
