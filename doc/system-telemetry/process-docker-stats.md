| 0.1 | 09/12/19 | Pradnya Mohite | Initial version    |

## Scope
-Enable sonic streaming telemetry agent to send Process and docker stats data

### Enable sonic streaming telemetry agent to send Process and docker stats data

##### Part 1 
For 1st part, Daemon code will be added under sonic-buildimage/files/image_config.  A Daemon will start when OS starts. At every 2 min interval it will do following:  
Delete all entries for Process and Docker stats from state db  
Update Process and Docker stats data to state-DB.  
Update last update time for process and Docker stats.  

Details of CLI and state-DB given below. 

##### Part 2
Verify that from state-DB data is available via telemetry agent

##### CLI output  and corresponding structure in state-DB for process and docker stats

###### Process stats

```
$ ps -eo uid,pid,ppid,%mem,%cpu,stime,tty,time,cmd

 UID   PID  PPID %MEM %CPU STIME TT           TIME CMD
    0     1     0  0.1  0.0 Oct15 ?        00:00:09 /sbin/init
    0     2     0  0.0  0.0 Oct15 ?        00:00:00 [kthreadd]
    0     3     2  0.0  0.0 Oct15 ?        00:00:01 [ksoftirqd/0]
    0     5     2  0.0  0.0 Oct15 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/0:0H]

```
above output will be stored inside state-DB as follows for largest 1024 CPU consumption processes:  

```
PROCESS_STATS|4276

"PID"  
"1"  
"PPID"

"Oct15"  
"TIME"

"CMD"

```
Along with data new entry for timestamp will be updated in state_db:  

```
PROCESS_STATS|LastUpdateTime  
```

###### Docker stats

```
$ docker stats --no-stream -a

```
above output will be stored inside state-DB as follows:
