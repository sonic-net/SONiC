## overview

The purpose is to test vrf functionality on the SONIC switch DUT, closely mimic the production environment. The test will use testbed's basic configuration as default and load different vrf configurations according to the test cases.

### Scope

The test is running on real SONIC switch with testbed's basic configuration. The purpose of the test is not to test specific C/C++ class or APIs, those tests are coverd by vs test cases. The purpose is to do VRF functional test on a SONIC system. They include vrf creation/deletion, neighbor/route learning in vrf, binding/unbinding vrf to L3 intf, isolation among vrfs, acl redirection/everflow in vrf and vrf attributes function.

### Testbed

The test will run on the `t0` testbed:

## Setup configuration

### vrf config in t0 topo

![vrf-t0_topo](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/vrf-test-case/images/vrf_hld/vrf_t0_topo.png)

### Scripts for generating configuration on SONIC

There are some j2 template files for the vrf test configuration. They are used to generate json files and apply them on the DUT.

### Pytest scripts to setup and run test

Newly added `test_vrf.py` will be put in 'sonic-mgmt/tests/' directory.

### Setup of DUT switch

Setup of SONIC DUT will be done by SONiC CLI. During the setup process pytest will use SONiC CLI to config vrf, bind intf to vrf and add ip address to intf.

#### bgp vrf configuration

We modify /usr/share/sonic/templates/frr.conf.j2 to generate the frr.conf include vrf configuration and apply the frr.conf to zebra process. The new config_db.json file in T0 topo is the following.

#### acl redirect vrf configuration

Acl redirect action supports vrf, so we need specify the outgoing interface of the nexthop explicitly, the acl redirect configuration template is as following:

```jason
{
    "ACL_TABLE": {
        "VRF_ACL_REDIRECT_V4": {
            "policy_desc": "Redirect traffic to nexthop in different vrfs",
            "type": "L3",
            "ports": ["{{ src_port }}"]
        },

        "VRF_ACL_REDIRECT_V6": {
            "policy_desc": "Redirect traffic to nexthop in different vrfs",
            "type": "L3V6",
            "ports": ["{{ src_port }}"]
        }
    },
    "ACL_RULE": {
        "VRF_ACL_REDIRECT_V4|rule1": {
            "priority": "55",
            "SRC_IP": "10.0.0.1",
            "packet_action": "redirect:{\% for intf, ip in redirect_dst_ipv6s \%}{{ ip ~ "@" ~ intf }}{{ "," if not loop.last else "" }}{\% endfor \%}"
        },
        "VRF_ACL_REDIRECT_V6|rule1": {
            "priority": "55",
            "SRC_IPV6": "2000::1",
            "packet_action": "redirect:{\% for intf, ip in redirect_dst_ipv6s \%}{{ ip ~ "@" ~ intf }}{{ "," if not loop.last else "" }}{\% endfor \%}"
        }
    }
}
NOTE: In the above rules, a backslash is used before % symbol related to FOR loops to avoid the github build failure. While using the actual code, remove the backslash.
```

#### teardown operation after each test case

- Restore original topo-t0 configuration

## PTF Test

### Input files for PTF test

PTF test will generate traffic between ports and make sure the traffic forwarding is expected according to the vrf configuration. Depending on the testbed topology and the existing configuration (e.g. ECMP, LAGS, etc) packets may forward to different interfaces. Therefore port connection information will be generated from the minigraph and supplied to the PTF script.

### Traffic validation in PTF

Depending on the test cases PTF will verify the packet is arrived or dropped. For vrf "src_mac" option test, PTF will analyze ip packet dst_mac after L3 forwarding through vrf and do L3 forwarding only when ip packet's dst_mac is matched with configed vrf "src_mac".

## Test cases

### Test case #1 - vrf creat and bind

#### Test objective <!-- omit in toc -->

verify vrf creat and bind intf to vrf

#### Test steps <!-- omit in toc -->

- config load vrf configuration
- verify vrf and ip configuration in kernel
- verify vrf and ip configuration in app_db

### Test case #2 - neighbor learning in vrf

#### Test objective <!-- omit in toc -->

verify arp/neighbor learning in vrf

#### Test steps <!-- omit in toc -->

- from DUT ping vms successfully
- verify neighbor entries by traffic

### Test case #3 - route learning in vrf

#### Test objective <!-- omit in toc -->

Verify v4/v6 route learning in vrf

#### Test steps <!-- omit in toc -->

- bgp load new frr.conf
- DUT exchange routes information with peer VMs
  - each vm propagates 6.4K ipv4 route and 6.4k ipv6 route to DUT.
- verify route entries by traffic(choose some routes)

### Test case #4 - isolation among different vrfs

#### Test objective <!-- omit in toc -->

The neighbor and route entries should be isolated among different vrfs.

#### Test steps <!-- omit in toc -->

- load vrf configuration and frr.conf
- both vms and DUT exchange routes via bgp
  - route prefix overlaps in different vrfs.
- verify traffic matched neighbor entry isolation in different vrf
- verify traffic matched route entry isolation in different vrf

### Test case #5 - acl redirect in vrf

#### Test objective <!-- omit in toc -->

ACL redirection can redirect packets to the nexthop with specified interface bound to the vrf.

#### Test steps <!-- omit in toc -->

- load acl_redirect configuration file
- PTF send pkts
- verify PTF ports can not receive pkt from origin L3 forward destination ports
- verify PTF ports can receive pkt from configured nexthop group member
- verify load balance between nexthop group members
- Restore configuration

### Test case #6 - loopback interface

#### Test objective <!-- omit in toc -->

User can configurate multiple loopback interfaces. Each interface can belong to different vrf.

#### Test steps <!-- omit in toc -->

- load loopback configuration file
- On ptf in different vrf ping DUT loopback interface ip address
- Verify if ping operation is successful
- use loopback interface as bgp update-source in vrf
- verify bgp session state is Established
- Restore configuration

### Test case #7 - Vrf WarmReboot

#### Test objective <!-- omit in toc -->

#### Test objective <!-- omit in toc -->

Use CLI to remove vrf when intfs is bound to the vrf, all ip addresses of the intfs belonging to the vrf should be deleted and all neighbor and route entries related to this vrf should be removed. The entries in other vrf should not be effected.

#### Test steps <!-- omit in toc -->

- load vrf configuration and frr.conf
- verify route and neigh status is okay
- remove specified vrf using CLI
- verify ip addresses of the interfaces belonging to the vrf are removed by traffic
- verify neighbor and route entries removed by traffic
- verify neighbor and route entries in other vrf existed by traffic
- Restore configuration

## TODO

- vrf table attributes 'fallback lookup' test
- vrf route leaking between VRFS
- everflow support in vrf
- application test in VRF such as ssh
