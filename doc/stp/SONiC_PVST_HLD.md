# 1 Requirement Overview
## 1.1 Functional Requirements


 1. Support PVST+ per VLAN spanning tree
 2. Support Portfast functionality
 3. Support Uplink fast functionality
 4. Support BPDU guard functionality
 5. Support Root guard functionality
 6. Bridge-id should include the VLAN id of the pvst instance along with bridge MAC address to derive a unique value for each instance.
 7. Port channel path cost will be same as the member port cost, it will not be cumulative of member ports cost
 8. DA MAC in case of PVST should be cisco pvst mac - 01:00:0C:CC:CC:CD
 9. Support protocol operation on static breakout ports
 10. Support protocol operation on Port-channel interfaces


## 1.2 Configuration and Management Requirements
This feature will support CLI and REST based configurations.
 1. Support CLI configurations as mentioned in section 3.6.2
 2. Support show commands as mentioned in section 3.6.3
 3. Support debug commands as mentioned in section 3.6.4
 4. Support Openconfig yang model - with extensions for supporting PVST 
 5. Support REST APIs for config and operational data

## 1.3 Scalability Requirements
16k port-vlan instances with max 255 STP instances.
The scaling limit might differ depending on the platform and the CPU used, which needs to be determined based on testing.

## 1.4 Warm Boot Requirements

Warm boot is not supported in this release. User is expected to do cold reboot when PVST is running so that topology will reconverge and traffic will be redirected via alternate paths.

If PVST is enabled and user tries to perform warm reboot an error will be displayed indicating PVST doesnt support warm reboot.


# 2 Functionality

## 2.1 Functional Description
The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) prevents Layer 2 loops in a network and provides redundant links. If a primary link fails, the backup link is activated and network traffic is not affected. STP also ensures that the least cost path is taken when multiple paths exist between the devices.

When the spanning tree algorithm is run, the network switches transform the real network topology into a spanning tree topology. In an STP topology any LAN in the network can be reached from any other LAN through a unique path. The network switches recalculate a new spanning tree topology whenever there is a change to the network topology.

For each switch in the topology, a port with lowest path cost to the root bridge is elected as root port.

For each LAN, the switches that attach to the LAN select a designated switch that is the closest to the root switch. The designated switch forwards all traffic to and from the LAN. The port on the designated switch that connects to the LAN is called the designated port. The switches decide which of their ports is part of the spanning tree. A port is included in the spanning tree if it is a root port or a designated port.

PVST+ allows for running multiple instances of spanning tree on per VLAN basis. 

One of the advantage with PVST is it allows for load-balancing of the traffic. When a single instance of spanning tree is run and a link is put into blocking state for avoiding the loop, it will result in inefficient bandwidth usage. With per VLAN spanning tree multiple instances can be run such that for some of the instances traffic is blocked over the link and for other instances traffic is forwared allowing for load balancing of traffic.

PVST+ support allows the device to interoperate with IEEE STP and also tunnel the PVST+ BPDUs transparently across IEEE STP region to potentially connect other PVST+ switches across the IEEE STP region. For interop with IEEE STP, PVST+ will send untagged IEEE BPDUs (MAC - 01:80:C2:00:00:00) with information corresponding to VLAN 1. The STP port must be a member of VLAN 1 for interoperating with IEEE STP.

# 3 Design
## 3.1 Overview

![STP](images/STP_Architecture.png "Figure 1: High level architecture")
__Figure 1: High level architecture__

High level overview:

STP container will host STPMgr and STPd process.

STPMgr will handle all the STP configurations and VLAN configurations via config DB and state DB respectively.

STPd process will handle all the protocol functionality and has following interactions

 * Linux kernel for packet tx/rx and netlink events
 * STPMgr interaction for configuration handling
 * STPSync is part of STPd handling all the STP operational data updates to APP DB 

Alternate design consideration:
Linux kernel has support for spanning-tree but is not being considered for following reasons 
 * Supports only STP, no support for RSTP and MSTP
 * Currently SONiC does not create a netdevice for each vlan, port combination as it relies on vlan aware bridge configuration. For supporting per VLAN spanning tree a netdevice needs to be created for each vlan, port combination, this will result in higher memory requirements due to additional netdevices and also a major change from SONiC perspective.

    max_stp_inst        = 1*3DIGIT               ; Max STP instances supported by HW 


## 3.3 Switch State Service Design
### 3.3.1 Orchestration Agent

All STP operations for programming the HW will be handled as part of OrchAgent. OrchAgent will listen to below updates from APP DB for updating the ASIC DB via SAI REDIS APIs.

 * Port state udpate - STP_PORT_STATE_TABLE

 * VLAN to instance mapping - STP_VLAN_INSTANCE_TABLE

Orchagent will also listen to updates related to Fast ageing on APP DB. When fast ageing is set for the VLAN due to topology change, Orchagent will perform FDB/MAC flush for the VLAN. 

 * FDB/MAC flush - STP_FASTAGEING_FLUSH_TABLE



## 3.4 STP Container

STP container will have STPMgr and STPd processes.

STPMgr process will register with the config DB for receiving all the STP configurations and with state DB for VLAN configurations. STPMgr will notify this configuration information to STPd for protocol operation. STPMgr will also handle the STP instance allocation.

STPd process will handle following interactions. STPd will use libevent for processing the incoming events and timers.
1) Packet processing 

   * Socket of PF_PACKET type will be created for packet tx/rx 

   * Filters will be attached to the socket to receive the STP BPDUs based on DA MAC

   * PACKET_AUXDATA socket option will be set to get the VLAN id of the packet received from the cmsg headers

2) Configuration - All STP CLI and VLAN configurations will be received from STPMgr via unix domain socket
3) Timers handling - Timer events are generated every 100ms for handling STP protocol timers
4) Port events - Netlink socket interface for processing create/delete of port, lag interface, lag member add/delete, link state changes and port speed
5) Operational updates - STPsync is part of STPd and handles all the updates to APP DB. All DB interactions are detailed in the Section 4.
6) STP Port state sync to linux kernel - Currently the vlan aware bridge doesnt support programming the STP state into linux bridge. As a workaround, when STP state is not forwarding, corresponding VLAN membership on that port will be removed to filter the packets on blocking port.

### Interface DB:

In SONiC, ethernet interface is represented in the format Ethernet<id\> where id represents the physical port number and port-channel is represented by PortChannel<id\> where id is a 4 digit numerical value. 

STPd implementation makes use of its own internal port id for its protocol operation. These port ids are used for bit representation in port masks and also for indexing the array which holds the pointers to STP port level information. So to continue using these mechanisms it is required to convert the SONiC representation of interface to local STP port ids. So when STPd interacts with other components in the system local port id will be converted to SONiC interface name, similarly all messages received from other components with SONiC interface name will be converted to local STP port id before processing. For this purpose an interface DB (AVL tree) will be maintained to map the SONiC interface names to local STP port ids. 



### Local STP Port id allocation:

For allocating local port ids STPd needs to know the max number of physical ports and Port-channel interfaces supported on the device. Currently there is no mechanism to obtain these values in a direct way (like reading from DBs) so below logic will be used to arrive at max ports -

Max STP Ports = Max physical ports + Max Port-Channel interfaces 

where,

Max physical ports will be determined from the higher interface id populated say for example if higher port is Ethernet252 (or 254) - max ports will be 256 to ensure breakout ports are accomodated.

Max Port-Channel interfaces will be same as max physical ports to accomodate the worst case scenario of each Port-channel having only one port.


Post bootup, Portsyncd reads the port_config.ini file which contains the port specific configuration information, and updates the APP DB with this information. Orchagent listens to these APP DB updates and takes care of creating all the interfaces in linux kernel and the hardware. Kernel sends netlink updates for the interfaces being created which Portsyncd listens to, once Portsyncd confirms all the interfaces have been configured it will generate PortInitDone notification. STPd will receive this message via STPMgr and then gets all the interface information via netlink for allocating the local STP port ids.

Note: The port id for Port-channel interface will be allocated only when the first member port is added, this ensures Port-channel interfaces with no member ports dont burn the port ids. 

Example of port id allocation -
```
SONiC interface          STP Port id
Ethernet0                    0
Ethernet4                    4
Ethernet8                    8
Ethernet252                 252
PortChannel10               256
PortChannel5                257
PortChannel20               258
```

Note: As Port-channel port ids are dynamically allocated it might result in same port channel getting different value post reboot. To ensure a predictable convergence where port-channel port id is used as tie breaker, user needs to configure appropriate port priority value.

### 3.4.1 BPDU trap mechanism
SONiC uses copp configuration file 00-copp.config.json for configuring the trap group, ids, cpu priority queue and a policer. This functionality has been extended for supporting STP and PVST BPDU trap to CPU.

## 3.5 SAI
STP SAI interface APIs are already defined and is available at below location -

https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/master/inc/saistp.h

Control packet traps required for STP (SAI_HOSTIF_TRAP_TYPE_STP) and PVST (SAI_HOSTIF_TRAP_TYPE_PVRST) are defined in below SAI spec -

https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/master/inc/saihostif.h 

## 3.6 CLI
### 3.6.1 Data Models
Openconfig STP yang model will be extended to support PVST.

### 3.6.2 Configuration Commands

### 3.6.2.1 Global level 

### 3.6.2.1.1 Enabling or Disabling of PVST feature - Global spanning-tree mode
This command allows enabling the spanning tree mode for the device. 

**config spanning_tree {enable|disable} {pvst}**

Note: 
1) When global pvst mode is enabled, by default spanning tree will be enabled on the first 255 VLANs, for rest of the VLAN spanning tree will be disabled.
2) When multiple spanning-tree modes are supported, only one mode can be enabled at any given point of time.

### 3.6.2.1.2 Per VLAN spanning-tree 
This command allows enabling or disabling spanning-tree on a VLAN.

**config spanning_tree vlan {enable|disable} <vlan\>**

 ### 3.6.2.1.3 Root-guard timeout

This command allows configuring a root guard timeout value. Once superior BPDUs stop coming on the port, device will wait for a period until root guard timeout before moving the port to forwarding state(default = 30 secs), range 5-600.

**config spanning_tree root_guard_timeout <value\>**

 ### 3.6.2.1.4 Forward-delay 

This command allows configuring the forward delay time in seconds (default = 15), range 4-30.

**config spanning_tree forward_delay <value\>**

 ### 3.6.2.1.5 Hello interval
This command allow configuring the hello interval in secs for transmission of bpdus (default = 2), range 1-10.

**config spanning_tree hello <value\>**

 ### 3.6.2.1.6 Max-age
This command allows configuring the maximum time to listen for root bridge in seconds (default = 20), range 6-40.

**config spanning_tree max_age <value\>**

 ### 3.6.2.1.7 Bridge priority
This command allows configuring the bridge priority in increments of 4096 (default = 32768), range 0-61440.

**config spanning_tree priority <value\>**

 ### 3.6.2.2 VLAN level 
Below commands are similar to the global level commands but allow configuring on per VLAN basis.

**config spanning_tree vlan forward_delay <vlan\> <fwd-delay-value\>**

**config spanning_tree vlan hello <vlan\> <hello-value\>**

**config spanning_tree vlan max_age <vlan\> <max-age-value\>**

**config spanning_tree vlan priority <vlan\> <priority-value\>**

 ### 3.6.2.3 VLAN, interface level 
Below configurations allow STP parameters to be configured on per VLAN, interface basis.

 ### 3.6.2.3.1 Port Cost
This command allows to configure the port level cost value for a VLAN, range 1 - 200000000

**config spanning_tree vlan interface cost <vlan\> <ifname\> <value\>**

 ### 3.6.2.3.2 Port priority
This command allows to configure the port level priority value for a VLAN, range 0 - 240 (default 128)

**config spanning_tree vlan interface priority <vlan\> <ifname\> <value\>**

 ### 3.6.2.4 Interface level 

 ### 3.6.2.4.1 STP enable/disable on interface

This command allows enabling or disabling of STP on an interface, by default STP will be enabled on the interface if global STP mode is configured.

**config spanning_tree interface {enable|disable} <ifname\>** 

 ### 3.6.2.4.2 Root Guard:
The Root Guard feature provides a way to enforce the root bridge placement in the network and allows STP to interoperate with user network bridges while still
maintaining the bridged network topology that the administrator requires. When BPDUs are received on a root guard enabled port, the STP state will be moved to "Root inconsistent" state to indicate this condition. Once the port stops receiving superior BPDUs, Root Guard will automatically set the port back to a FORWARDING state after the timeout period has expired.

This command allow enabling or disabling of root guard on an interface.

**config spanning_tree interface root_guard {enable|disable} <ifname\>**

Following syslogs will be generated when entering and exiting root guard condition respectively - 

STP: Root Guard interface Ethernet4, VLAN 100 inconsistent (Received superior BPDU)

STP: Root Guard interface Ethernet4, VLAN 100 consistent (Timeout)

 ### 3.6.2.4.3 BPDU Guard
BPDU Guard feature disables the connected device ability to initiate or participate in STP on edge ports. When STP BPDUs are received on the port where BPDU guard is enabled the port will be shutdown. User can re-enable the port administratively after ensuring the BPDUs have stopped coming on the port.

Below command allows enabling or disabling of bpdu guard on an interface.

**config spanning_tree interface bpdu_guard {enable|disable} <ifname\>**


By default, BPDU guard will only generate a syslog indicating the condition, for taking an action like disabling the port below command can be used with shutdown option

**config spanning_tree interface bpdu_guard {enable|disable} <ifname\> [--shutdown | -s]**

Following syslog will be generated when BPDU guard condition is entered -

STP: Tagged BPDU(100) received, interface Ethernet4 disabled due to BPDU guard trigger

STPd will update the config DB for shutting down the interface, user can enable the interface back once it has stopped receiving the BPDUs.

 ### 3.6.2.4.4 Port fast
Portfast command is enabled by default on all ports, portfast allows edge ports to move to forwarding state quickly when the connected device is not participating in spanning-tree.

Below command allows enabling or disabling of portfast on an interface.

**config spanning_tree interface portfast {enable|disable} <ifname\>**

 ### 3.6.2.4.4 Uplink fast
 Uplink fast feature enhances STP performance for switches with redundant uplinks. Using the default value for the standard STP forward delay, convergence following a transition from an active link to a redundant link can take 30 seconds (15 seconds for listening and an additional 15 seconds for learning).

When uplink fast is configured on the redundant uplinks, it reduces the convergence time to just one second by moving to forwarding state (bypassing listening and learning modes) in just once second when the active link goes down. 

**config spanning_tree interface uplink_fast {enable|disable} <ifname\>**

 ### 3.6.2.4.5 Port level priority
This command allows to configure the port level priority value, range 0 - 240 (default 128)

**config spanning_tree interface priority <ifname\> <value\>**

 ### 3.6.2.4.6 Port level path cost
This command allows to configure the port level cost value, range 1 - 200000000

**configure spanning_tree interface cost <ifname\> <value\>**
