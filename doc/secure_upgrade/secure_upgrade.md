###  1.2. <a name='Scope'></a>Scope

This secure upgrade hld doc described the requirements, architecture, and general flow details of secure upgrade feature in switches SONIC OS based.

###  1.3. <a name='DefinitionsAbbreviations'></a>Definitions/Abbreviations

	SU - secure upgrade
	SB - secure boot	
	CMS - Cryptographic Message Syntax

###  1.4. <a name='Overview'></a>Overview

Secure installation and upgrade of OS are setting a requirement to ensure the image was not modified since it was built by the vendor. This is a basic requirement as part of general OS security. In order to help the credibility of the OS image, secure upgrade mechanism guarantees the image was not modified by any unauthorized entity since its original creation.

###  1.5. <a name='Requirements'></a>Requirements

We want to enable secure upgrade of SONIC. This will include secure upgrade of SONIC while installing SONIC via ONIE or SONIC. The feature requires a signing process which requires a signing private key and certificate and a verification process which requires a public key certificate for validation. Both processes are required to be supported by various scenarios such as development and release.
In order to do secure installation of SONIC from ONIE, it has to include the flowing secure upgrade verification commit TODO (on pull request - waiting for it to be created)
Device arch should support secure boot including UEFI tools.

###  1.6. <a name='ArchitectureDesign'></a>Architecture Design
####  1.6.1. <a name='InstallationFlow'></a>Installation Flow
![su_installation_flows](su_installation_flows.png)

####  1.6.2. <a name='signing'></a>signing
![signing_flow](signing_flow.png)
(flow description in the chapter below)
####  1.6.3. <a name='verification'></a>verification
Verification flow calls a verification script during image installation, in (1.7.3.) verification process below.

###  1.7. <a name='High-LevelDesign'></a>High-Level Design


This feature has 2 flows to be supported:
	
####  1.7.1. <a name='Signingprocess'></a>Signing process  

Sign sonic image during build process in build_image.sh script, right after generation.
We want to add the flags SONIC_SU_MODE_ENABLED and SONIC_SU_PROD_ENABLED to allow several modes of secure upgrade- when SONIC_SU_MODE_ENABLED == n no change will be made to the current build process. In case of SONIC_SU_MODE_ENABLED == y SONIC_SU_PROD_ENABLED will determine if we sign with development script (equals 'n') or production script (equals 'y').
![build_options](build_options.png)
- After image creation, during onie-mk-demo.sh script, we create a new output file with the prefix sharch.sh script and the image. We calculate sha1 and original image size and update them in the prefix for verification during image install.
- We will call a dedicated script to create an image signature:
We will allow the use of 2 script types in this flow -

	a.  development script - su_sign_image_dev.sh, which will use simple cms openSSL signing (enable with flag set to SONIC_SU_MODE_ENABLED == y and SONIC_SU_PROD_ENABLED == n) with development keys.

	b.  production script - su_sign_image_prod.sh (enable with the flag set to SONIC_SU_PROD_ENABLED == y) that each vendor will be able to provide for himself.

####  1.7.2. <a name='Verificationprocess'></a>Verification process
- SONIC install â€“ changes will be mainly done in sonic-installer main.py where bootloader methods are being called and will only affect 'sonic-installer install' command (other sonic-installer commands will not be affected). The installation process is triggered by install.sh script, which is different for every platform.
In our opinion, python modifications will be easier to add and maintain than install.sh changes, as changing install.sh (for each platform) will require much more sources to maintain and test (different HW to check on, test cases for each HW, etc.).
- A signed image will go through a verification process before installation, as main.py will call a dedicated bash script to split the signature from the image and check it with a public key certificate.

Corresponding to the image build flow we have the following split:

a. on development we will use development script - su_verify_image_sign_dev.sh (enable with flag SONIC_SU_MODE_ENABLED == y and SONIC_SU_PROD_ENABLED == n) which will verify using OpenSSL cms. The certificate will be fetched from BIOS using EFI tools.


b. on production we will use su_verify_image_sign_prod.sh (enable with flag SONIC_SU_PROD_ENABLED == y) that vendors can override as well.

###  1.11. <a name='RestrictionsLimitations'></a> Restrictions/Limitations  
####  1.11.1. <a name='uefitoolsandsecurebootenabled'></a> uefi tools and secure boot enabled
Device arch should support secure boot including UEFI tools.
This feature is dependent on BIOS secure boot flag being enabled.
####  1.11.2. <a name='ONIEsecureupgradeverificationcode'></a> ONIE secure upgrade verification code
Secure installation of SONIC from ONIE requires a specific verification code, which can be picked from the following ONIE pull request TODO

###  1.12. <a name='Upgradeanddowngradeflows'></a> Upgrade and downgrade flows
we want to discuss the following flows:
####  1.12.1. <a name='secureupgradefromnonsecuredSONICONIEtosecuredSONIC'></a> secure upgrade from non secured SONIC/ONIE to secured SONIC
In this flow, the signature is not verified as no verification code is available at this stage. If we assume secure upgrade SONIC image is credible, then the upgraded OS will support secure upgrade flow.
####  1.12.2. <a name='secureupgradefromsecuredSONICtosecuredSONIC'></a> secure upgrade from secured SONIC to secured SONIC
This is the main flow supported by the feature - each signed image will be verified before its installation.
####  1.12.3. <a name='downgradefromsecuredSONICtonon-securedSONIC'></a> downgrade from secured SONIC to non-secured SONIC
This flow will only be enabled if secure boot BIOS flag is disabled, as we assume users with access to BIOS should have the ability to downgrade the OS version.
####  1.12.4. <a name='secureupgradefromsecureupgradeenabledONIEtosecuredSONIC'></a>secure upgrade from secure upgrade enabled ONIE to secured SONIC
As mentioned in 1.5 and 1.11.2, this flow requires secure upgrade enabled ONIE, with code available in TODO.
###  1.13. <a name='TestingRequirementsDesign'></a> Testing Requirements/Design 
####  1.13.1. <a name='UnitTestcases'></a>Unit Test cases  
We can use the verification script su_verify_image_sign_dev.sh as part of standalone test cases, without the need to run the whole installation process. 

Note - The script has the ability to support the use of a public key that was provided by the user and not only from BIOS. 

- Good flows:
  
  -  verify image - check basic flow of signing and verification
- Bad flows:
	-  Check if verification catches bad images:
		-Verify image that was modified after build
		-Verify image with wrong image size in sharch
		-Verify image with the wrong sha1 in sharch
		-Verify image with modified signature
		-Verify image signed with one key and verified with a different key 

####  1.13.2. <a name='SystemTestcases'></a>System Test cases
- Good flow

	- The basic test will include building a signed image and installing it after verification.
- Bad flow
	
	- Trying to install unsigned image on secure boot enabled machine.

###  1.14. <a name='OpenActionitems-ifany'></a>Open/Action items - if any 

NOTE: All the sections and sub-sections given above are mandatory in the design document. Users can add additional sections/sub-sections if required.
