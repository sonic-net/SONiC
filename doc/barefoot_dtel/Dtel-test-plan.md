# Overview
This document provides details on Dataplane telemetry testing on a SONiC switch DUT. Every test performs set up and tear down of all DTel related configuration required for it to execute. Tests are written to verify DTel functionality in the data path, indirectly verifying that configuration from SONiC was propagated correctly.  

# Test structure 
Every test is responsible for installing and clearing all the required configuration. A new Python module that reads and writes DTel-specific configuration into Config DB will be added to sonic-mgmt repo. This module contains two submodules. The first one is called "dtel" and it implements an abstraction of dataplane telemetry and all its associated concepts, such as report sessions, watchlists, etc. It contains the following files:

File name				     | Description
----------------------------| -------------
switch.py	            | Getters, setters and validators for switch global level attributes 
dtel\_report\_session.py| Getters, setters and validators for report session attributes
dtel\_int\_session.py   | Getters, setters and validators for INT session attributes
dtel\_queue\_report.py  | Getters, setters and validators for queue reporting attributes
dtel\_event.py          | Getters, setters and validators for DTel event attributes
dtel\_watchlist.py		  | Getters, setters and validators for DTel flow and drop watchlists 

The second submodule is called "sonic" and it implements the SONiC-specific functionality for dataplane telemetry configuration. All classes within this submodule inherit from the according class of the "dtel" submodule, and extend their properties and methods. "sonic" contains the following files:

File name				     | Description
----------------------------| -------------
sonic\_switch.py	            | Getters, setters and validators for switch global level attributes 
sonic\_dtel\_report\_session.py| Getters, setters and validators for report session attributes
sonic\_dtel\_int\_session.py   | Getters, setters and validators for INT session attributes
sonic\_dtel\_queue\_report.py  | Getters, setters and validators for queue reporting attributes
sonic\_dtel\_event.py          | Getters, setters and validators for DTel event attributes
sonic\_dtel\_watchlist.py		  | Getters, setters and validators for DTel flow and drop watchlists 

As an example, setting/getting DSCP attribute for a DTel event object is done using the following routines defined in sonic\_dtel\_event.py:

```
	@property
    def dscp_value(self):
        value = int(self.switch.redis_read('DTEL_E_EVENT_TABLE', self.hashname, 'EVENT_DSCP_VALUE'))
        dtel_event.DTelEvent.dscp_value.fset(self, value)
        return dtel_event.DTelEvent.dscp_value.fget(self)

    @dscp_value.setter
    def dscp_value(self, value):
        dtel_event.DTelEvent.dscp_value.fset(self, value)
        self.switch.redis_write('DTEL_E_EVENT_TABLE', self.hashname, 'EVENT_DSCP_VALUE', value)
``` 

## Testbed
DTel tests will run on __ptf32__ topology described in:
[SONiC test topologies](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-mgmt/blob/master/ansible/doc/README.testbed.Topology.md)

## Ansible scripts to setup and run test

### dtel.yml
When this yml file is run with tag "dtel", it will execute every DTel test that each do the following:

* Set up configuration needed for the test
* Construct test packet and send it to DUT
* Verify received data packet and telemetry report packet (as it applies to the test)
* Restore original configuration

# PTF Test
All ACL related tests should pass to make sure there were no regressions introduced.

## Test case # 1: INT end-point as INT source
__Test steps__

* INT end-point configuration set up on DUT:
	* Switch ID
	* INT L4 DSCP

		* collect switch id=True
		* collect switch ports=False
		* collect ingress timestamp=False
		* collect egress timestamp=False
		* collect queue info=False
	* Flow watchlist with following criteria:
		* Source IP of incoming packet
		* Destination IP of incoming packet
		* Ether type = 0x800
		* INT session ID set to previously configured session's ID
		* Sample percent = 100
		* Report all packets = True
* PTF host will generate a UDP packet with SRC and DST IPs matching the ones in the watchlist configured and send it to DUT
* PTF docker should receive a packet from DUT with INT header added in-band
* Repeat with packet not matching flow watchlist entry and PTF docker should receive a packet from DUT without INT header
* Repeat with INT disabled and PTF docker should receive a packet from DUT without INT header

## Test case # 2: INT end-point as INT sink
__Test steps__

	* INT sink ports list
	* INT end-point mode enable
	* Latency quantization set
