# 4. Design considerations

- MCLAG domain consists of only two systems.
- Each system only join one MC-LAG domain
- Supports Known Unicast and BUM traffic
- L3 interface on MLAG ports will have vMAC generated from VRRP algorithm using the same IP address assigned to the L3 LIF (logical interface)；(Not supported currently)
- ARP reply and ND advertisement packet sync-up between MC-LAG peers
- FDB sync-up between MC-LAG peers
- Support pure L2 MC-LAG port and MC-LAG L3 routed port or MC-LAG L2 port joining L3 vlan interface

> [caveat: vlan interface does not go down when the last port in the
> vlan goes down, need further discussion in the community with
> regarding the 1Q or 1D model]

The features below are not supported currently, may provide solutions in future releases.

- More consistency checking, both between peer switches and MLAG port channels configured on the switches, e.g. port speed configuration
- Peer-link with a detection mechanism, and with robust "split brain" detection
- Configurable peer master/slave roles for the peer switches
- VRRP/VARP for active/active gateway redundency
- Add feature support across MLAGs (e.g. STP, IGMP snooping, DHCP Relay)
- Make sure isolation ACL is installed in the ASIC table before MCLAG enabled portchannel is active

# 5. Brief introduction of ICCPd

- ICCP(Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol) is defined in RFC7275，our MLAG control plane implements the light version of ICCP. RFC7275 has very complicated state machines, information to be synced up between peers are very heavy, sanity checks are accordingly too many. So-called Lite Version is that MLAG ICCPd only implements a subset of the state machines defined in RFC7275 without compromising the usefulness and integrity.

- ICCP protocol using TCP port 8888 to make connection between peers, ICCP lite will do configuration consistence check, sync up ARP table and MAC address of related interfaces.

## 5.1. Use-cases supported by ICCP lite

RFC7275 describes 4 use-cases, this ICCPd or ICCP lite support all of these use-cases:

![Diagram 5.1.1](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_5.1.1.png)

In the scenario of figure 2, the PEs within an RG (Redundancy Group) are co-located in the same physical location, e.g., point of presence (POP) or central office (CO). Furthermore, dedicated links provide the interconnect for ICCP among the PEs.

![Diagram 5.1.2](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_5.1.2.png)

In the scenario of figure 3, the PEs within an RG (Redundancy Group) are co-located in the same physical location (POP, CO). However, unlike the previous scenario, there are no dedicated links between the PEs. The interconnect for ICCP is provided through the core network to which the PEs are connected. Figure 3 depicts this model.

![Diagram 5.1.3](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_5.1.3.png)

In the scenario of figure 4, the PEs within an RG (Redundancy Group) are located in different physical locations to provide geographic redundancy. A dedicated interconnect is provided to link the PEs. The resiliency mechanisms for the interconnect are similar to those highlighted in the co-located interconnect counterpart.

![Diagram 5.1.4](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_5.1.4.png)

In the scenario of figure 5, the PEs of an RG (Redundancy Group) are located in different physical locations and the interconnect for ICCP is provided over the PSN network to which the PEs are connected. This interconnect option is more likely to be the one used for geo-redundancy, as it is more economically appealing compared to the geo-redundant dedicated interconnect option.

RFC7275 says that information sync and heartbeat checking can take a path that is different from the one for carrying data traffic. Running data traffic and control traffic on disjoint network paths is supported in this implementation.

Will MC-LAG work if there is no physical connection between the peers? In theory, if the peer IP address is reachable, there is no requirement to have physical connection between the peers. For example, the peer-link can be a Vxlan tunnel. ICCP may use this VXLAN tunnel if user configured the system properly.

## 5.2. ICCPd State machines

Lite version support “ICCP Connection State Machine”，shown as followings:
The ICCP Connection state machine is defined to have six states in RFC 7275 section 4.2.1, as below.

- NONEXISTENT: This state is the starting point for the state machine. It indicates that no ICCP connection exists between the PEs.

- INITIALIZED: This state indicates that an ICCP connection exists between the PEs but ICCP capability information has not yet been exchanged between them.

- CAPSENT: This state indicates that an ICCP connection exists between the PEs and that the local PE has advertised ICCP capability to its peer.

- CAPREC: This state indicates that an ICCP connection exists between the PEs and that the local PE has both received and advertised ICCP capability from/to its peer.

- CONNECTING: This state indicates that the local PE has initiated an ICCP connection to its peer and is awaiting its response.

- OPERATIONAL: This state indicates that the ICCP connection is operational.

![Diagram 5.2](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_5.2.png)
Diagram 5.2

RFC7275 also describes so called “Application Connection State Machine”, which are designed for application exclusively, and each application maintains its own state machines.

In this version, when ICCP state machine becomes OPERATIONAL, application state machine will be OPERATIONAL immediately. All application state machines will become OPERATIONAL.

In RFC7275 original requirements, ICCP will sync up many kinds of information with LACP protocol etc. This lite version does not implement the connection between ICCP and teamd to avoid the modification in teamd, there is no information exchange between ICCPd and teamd neither. ICCP work with teamd indirectly, for example, when ICCPd detects the change of MAC address for any MLAG member portchannel, ICCPd will inform Linux kernel and teamd will be hence notified by kernel.  In this way, teamd can notify LACP so that LACP in the server will form teamd interface. For not synced info, please check section 7.2 in the RFC 7275.

## 5.3. Role election

ICCP peer must be in active mode or standby mode. The ipv4 address is used to determine which role the peer has. Local ip and remote ip is configured manually, system compares these two ip addresses to determine its role, the one with large IP address is the standby, and the other one is active. Active is the client, standby is the server. The client connect to the server actively.

The role of active or standby is the concept of control plane. In the data plane, each peer determines the data forward path individually, no matter the role it is.

Another way to specify the active/standby role is via static configuration from config db. Currently static configuration from config db is not supported, may support it in the future.

## 5.4. Information sync up with ICCP

Following information are sync'ed up between ICCP lite peers.

1 system configuration：Sync up system MAC address. This is to serve LACP to derive the correct system ID. When the standby receives a system MAC from active, it will change local system ID to the peer system MAC.

2 Aggregator configuration: Sync up AGG_ID (portchannel ID, name, MAC etc) of MC-LAG enabled PortChannel, this is to record portchannel information of each peer. This info is used for sanity check as well as enabling packet forwarding in the peer link when a member link of MC-LAG goes down.

3 Aggregator State: Mainly exchanges MC-LAG enabled portchannel state (up/down) with AGG_ID. Generally, if the same named portchannels in each peer are both up, the data forwarding in the peer-link for that portchannel is disabled to prevent the data stream pass-through. When a portchannel of one peer is down, the peer-link is enabled for that portchannel to let the data stream pass-through.

4 ARP and ND information: ARP entries learned from kernel will be synced up with peer. The peer will update kernel as dynamically learned ARP once the ARP is synced via ICCP. ND is similar to ARP.

5 FDB information: FDB entries will be synced up with peer.

ICCP lite only supports port-configuration/state sync up for MC-LAG enabled ports. We don’t sync the static IP address, if a static IP address is configured on MC-LAG enabled PortChannel in one peer, the same IP address must be configured on the same PortChannel in the other peer.

## 5.5. ICCP Heartbeat sanity check

RFC7275 does not specify how to do the heartbeat check, but just suggest to use BFD or IP reachability monitoring to check if peer is reachable. This ICCP lite version defines a proprietary heartbeat message sent every 1s. If no such message is received within 15 consecutive intervals, then peer is declared as lost.

## 5.6. ICCP consistence check

This lite version does consistency check for the following contents:
1 Peer IP, local IP will be checked against with message contents.
2 Enable MC-LAG portchannel interface check: if it is L3 interface, then the IP address assigned must be the same. If they join a vlan, then the vlan must be the same etc.
3 Peer-link in both devices must be the same type.

There are other info to be checked, and will be supported in future releases. e.g.

- Physical layer: Port speed, Duplex, Flow control
- L2: VLAN mode and VID, STP config, etc

# 6. Typical configurations

## 6.1. Configuration syntax

```json
"MC_LAG": {
    "{{MC-LAG_domain_id}}": {
        "local_ip": {{ipv4_address}},
        "peer_link": {{interface_name}},
        "peer_ip": {{ipv4_address}},
        "mclag_interface": {{interface_name}}
    }
}

MC-LAG domain ID, must be from 1 to 65535.
"local_ip" is the ip address of this device to set TCP connection.
"peer_ip" is the ip address of peer device to set TCP connection.
"peer_link" is the name of interface that act as interconnection. For L3 scenario, the data forwarding depends on routing information, this is unnecessary.
"mclag_interface" is the name of PortChannel interfaces that has MC-LAG enabled, it can be a list of portChannel interfaces separated by commas ','.
```

## 6.2. MC-LAG L3 scenario configuration

![Diagram 6.2](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_6.2.png)
Diagram 6.2

In the L3 scenario, peer-link configuration is unnecessary. MC-LAG enabled interface PortChannel0001 is L3 interface.

## 6.3. MC-LAG L2 scenario configuration

![Diagram 6.3](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_6.3.png)
Diagram 6.3

In the L2 scenario, peer-link PortChannel0002 and MC-LAG enabled interface PortChannel0001 are both the member of vlan100. PortChannel0001 and PortChannel0002 use L2 forwarding.

# 7. Typical Data diagram for MCLAG

## 7.1. MC-LAG L3 scenario

### 7.1.1. MC-LAG enabled interface up

![Diagram 7.1.1](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_7.1.1.png)
Diagram 7.1.1

- In the above diagram, PortChannel0001 and PortChannel0002 areis mclag MC-LAG enabled interfaces, status is up.
- The data flow path is presented by the red line.
- The data flow path from PA to CE1: When the traffic reach PEER1, it will match the direct route, such as 10.1.1.0/24, and forwarded through PortChannel0001.
- The data flow path from CE1 to PA: CE1 may send the traffic to PEER1 or PEER2. PEER2 must has route entry that can reach PA. This route entry is installed by routing protocol.

### 7.1.2. MC-LAG enabled interface down

![Diagram 7.1.2](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_7.1.2.png)
Diagram 7.1.2

- In the above diagram, PortChannel0001 is MC-LAG enabled interface, status is down.
- The data flow path is presented by the yellow line for traffic from PA to CE1.
- The data flow path from PA to CE1: When PortChannel0001 in PEER1 is down, the direct route 10.1.1.0/24 will be deleted, the routing protocol (or a static route configuration) will make sure there is a backup route to reach CE1. When the traffic reaches PEER1, it will match the backup route, and forwarded through PortChannel0002.
- The data flow path from CE1 to PA: CE1 will detect the interface connecting to PEER1 is down, the data will send to PA via PEER2. The routing protocol will make sure there is a path to reach PA.

### 7.1.3. Link between peers

- In L3 scenario, routing protocol or static route configured manually provides backup path to reach MC-LAG enabled subnet.
- In this scenario, the direct-connected L3 peer link connecting the two peer devices is not required. When the MC-LAG member link is up, the direct route has the highest priority (e.g. longest prefix). If one of the MC-LAG member link is down, the direct route will be deleted, and the backup route will take effect.
- In L3 scenario, IP reachability is controlled by routing protocol, peer link configuration is unnecessary.

### 7.1.4. ARP and ND sync-up between MC-LAG peers

- If one peer learns an ARP entry, it will send the ARP entry to the other peer via ICCP. For example, PEER1 learns ARP entry of CE1 from PortChannel0001, it will send this ARP to PEER2 via ICCP. PEER2 receives this ARP entry, and install it into Linux kernel, the learned interface name is PortChannel0001. This requires the name of MC-LAG enabled PortChannel interface in both peer devices must be the same.
- ICCP don’t flood ARP entry to peer periodically. To prevent the ARP entry from aging, ICCP uses Netlink socket to monitor ARP reply received by Linux kernel. For example, when an ARP entry in PEER2 is aged, the Linux kernel will send an ARP request via PortChannel0001. CE1 receives the ARP request, and send back one ARP reply. For CE1, PEER1 and PEER2 are viewed as the same device, the ARP reply may send to PEER2 or PEER1. If PEER2 receives the ARP reply, the ARP entry is learned again and information is updated in the kernel. At the same time, PEER2 will notify PEER1 via ICCP sync message. If PEER1 receives the ARP reply, since the ARP entry already exists in the kernel, kernel will use Netlink to send the ARP packet to its applications, ICCP will collect the ARP information from the ARP reply packet and send to PEER2, so PEER2 can update the ARP entry in the Linux kernel.
- ND sync-up is similar to ARP sync-up. ICCP uses Netlink socket to monitor ND advertisement received by Linux kernel.

### 7.1.5. L3 multicast

- Since the control plane does not support multicast protocols, e.g. IGMP, PIM, so multicast L3 forwarding is not supported.

## 7.2. MC-LAG L2 scenario

### 7.2.1. MC-LAG enabled interface up

![Diagram 7.2.1](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_7.2.1.png)
Diagram 7.2.1

- In the above diagram, PortChannel0001 is MC-LAG enabled port, status is up, PortChannel0002 is peer link. PortChannel0001 and PortChannel0002 are in same VLAN. Just like portChannel0001, PortChannel0002 uses L2 forwarding. Assume PA to PEER1 connection is part of the same VLAN as PortChannel0001.
- The data flow path is presented by the red or yellow line.
- The data flow path from PA to CE1: When the traffic reach PEER1, it will match the MAC of CE1, and forwarded through PortChannel0001. If the MAC of CE1 is not learned in PEER1 yet, the traffic will be flooded in the VLAN. PEER2 will also receive the flooded packet, but it will not forward the packet to MC-LAG enabled ports.
- The data flow path from CE1 to PA: CE1 may send the traffic to PEER1 or PEER2. PEER2 may have PA’s MAC entry synced up from PEER1. If PEER2 does not have PA’s MAC entry, the packet from CE1 to PA will be flooded by PEER2 to PEER1 first, then PEER1 will unicast to PA.
- Peer link data forwarding is disabled for MC-LAG enabled interfaces. In the above diagram, if PEER2 receives traffic from PEER1 via PortChannel0002, the traffic will not be forwarded to PortChannel0001 since port isolation logic is applied.
- MAC learning in peer link is disabled. In the above diagram, MAC learning in PortChannel0002 is disabled in both PEER1 and PEER2.

### 7.2.2. MC-LAG enabled interface down

![Diagram 7.2.2](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_7.2.2.png)
Diagram 7.2.2

- In the above diagram, PortChannel0001 is MC-LAG enabled interface, status is down, PortChannel0002 is the peer link. Assume PA to PEER1 connection is part of the same VLAN as PortChannel0001.
- The data flow path is presented by the yellow line.
- The data flow path from PA to CE1: When PortChannel0001 in PEER1 is down, ICCP reprograms the nexthop of MAC entry to point to peer link PortChannel0002 and update the MAC entry in the ASIC table. When the traffic reaches PEER1, it will match the updated MAC entry, and forwarded through PortChannel0002.
- When PortChannel0001 in PEER1 is down, the portChannel state is synced to PEER2. ICCP in PEER2 enables the peer link forwarding for MC-LAG enabled interfaces corresponding to portChannel0001. In the above diagram, if PEER2 receives traffic from PEER1 via PortChannel0002, the traffic will be forwarded to CE1 via PortChannel0001.
- MAC learning of peer link is disabled. In the above diagram, MAC learning of PortChannel0002 is disabled in both PEER1 and PEER2.
- The data flow path from CE1 to PA: CE1 will detect the interface connecting to PEER1 is down, the data will send to PA via PEER2. PEER2 will bridge the packet to PEER1 where L2 bridging is performed to reach PA.

### 7.2.3. Link between peers

- In MC-LAG L2 scenario, peer link must be configured.
- The peer link can be either Ethernet, a PortChannel or a Vxlan tunnel. The peer link is used to carry data traffic when one of the MC-LAG member link is down and MAC forwarding reroute is needed.
- The ICCP control link and peer link can be different links. But if peer link is configured with a vlan IP interface, and ICCP local IP address or peer IP address is the IP address of this vlan interface, then ICCP control link and L2 peer link can be the same interface. We suggest to use different link for ICCP control and peer link in order to handle different fail scenarios efficiently.

### 7.2.4. MAC sync-up between MC-LAG peers

- If one peer learns a MAC entry from a MC-LAG enabled PortChannel, it will send this MAC to other peer via ICCP. For example, PEER1 learns MAC entry of CE1 from PortChannel0001, it will send this MAC to PEER2 via ICCP. PEER2 receives this MAC, and installs the MAC into Linux kernel, the learned interface is also PortChannel0001. This means the name of MC-LAG enabled PortChannel interface in both peer devices must be the same.
- If one peer learns a MAC entry from an orphan port, it will also send this MAC to other peer via ICCP. For example, PEER1 learns MAC entry of CE2 from Eth4, it will send this MAC to PEER2 via ICCP. PEER2 receives this MAC, and installs the MAC into Linux kernel, the learned interface is peer link interface PortChannel0002.
- ICCP don't flood MAC entry to peer periodically. To prevent the MAC entry from aging, ICCP defines two flags for each MAC entry, MAC_AGE_LOCAL and MAC_AGE_PEER. MAC_AGE_LOCAL indicates the MAC entry in my device is aged, and MAC_AGE_PEER indicates the same MAC entry in peer device is aged. The MAC entry will be deleted from my FDB only when the two flags are both set for this MAC. For example, if the MAC of CE1 ages out in PEER2, the MAC entry will set MAC_AGE_LOCAL. If this MAC entry is not set MAC_AGE_PEER flag at the same time (because the MAC entry on PEER1 isn't aged, hence it doesn't tell PEER2 to set the flag), it will be installed back to the ASIC. Then PEER2 notifies the MAC age event to PEER1, PEER1 will set MAC_AGE_PEER for the same MAC.

### 7.2.5. Peer link MAC learning

- When the MC-LAG enabled interface is up, peer link is the backup link for data traffic. MAC learning must be disabled on peer link to prevent data traffic from forwarding. If the learning is enabled, the same MAC (e.g. MAC of CE1) may be learned via MC-LAG port or peer link, and the output port of this MAC will keep toggling.
- When all local member links in an MC-LAG interface on one peer are down, MAC learning is also disabled in peer link, dynamic MAC entries will be installed to FDB pointing to peer link as the next hop, so traffic destined to those dynamic MAC entries will take the peer link path.

### 7.2.6. L2 BUM flooding and port isolation

- In the L2 scenario, MC-LAG enabled port and peer link are in the same VLAN. When both ports are up, BUM may be flooded before the MAC is learned.
- To prevent CE from receiving duplicated traffic, peer link port must be isolated from MC-LAG enabled port. In the diagram of 7.2.1, if PEER2 receives traffic from PEER1 via PortChannel0002, the traffic will not be forwarded to PortChannel0001. The following ASIC functions achieve this goal.
- In Linux kernel, ebtable is used to isolate peer link port from MC-LAG port. The Linux command is like ‘ebtables –A FORWARD -i PortChannel0002 -o PortChannel0001 -j DROP’. PortChannel0002 is the peer-link input interface, and PortChannel0001 is the output interface.
- In ASIC, ACL rule is used to isolate peer link from MC-LAG port. The rule is when the traffic is received from peer link and the output port is MC-LAG member port, the traffic must be dropped. For the chips whose ACL rule can't support out-port, there is a workaround in SAI layer by combination of ingress acl and egress acl. An alternative approach is to use isolation group. But The approach of isolation group still has some weakness, Firstly isolation group can't support tunnel-port and orchagent has not isolation group logic currently. Secondly isolation group may not be supported by all ASIC vendors. Using ACL is a more generic way to support the isolation function. We will refine this function to use isolation group later if it’s required.
- In theory a scenario may happen when the ACL installation process is slower than the port operation event notification. When the port is up in one peer, but the ACL is not installed in the other peer yet, the packet may be flooded over the peer link and the CE may receive the duplicated packet. Handling this scenario will be enhanced in future release.

## 7.3. Peer connection down

### 7.3.1. Keepalive link failure

![Diagram 7.3.1](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_7.3.1.png)
Diagram 7.3.1

- The peer keepalive is the MLAG control channel in current implementation.
- When the keepalive link is down, it causes the peer connection getting lost. But both peers are healthy in this case.
- Irrespective of the status of peer link, both devices are considering the peer device is down.
- This situation may look as a split-brain scenario (Both peers are healthy but there is no more real time synchronization between the peer devices), the standby peer changes its LACP system ID to the local default. Because the standby peer changed the LACP system ID, the CE device brings down the links connected to the standby. The result is all data traffic from CE are sent to the master.
- If keepalive link is restored, peer connection will be established again, information will be sync’ed up between ICCP peers. When the ICCP connection is active, the standby will change local system ID to the peer system’s ID (MAC), hence the MC-LAG enabled links connected to standby will become active again.

### 7.3.2. Peer device failure

![Diagram 7.3.2](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_7.3.2.png)
Diagram 7.3.2

- Peer device failure will cause ICCP connection to go down.
- If the master is down, the MC-LAG enabled ports connected CE are down, and the event is detected by the CE device. When the standby peer changes its LACP system ID to the local default, the CE device accepts the new LACP system ID of the links connected to the standby device. The result is all data traffic from CE are sent to the standby device. Since in current implementation it cannot distinguish this case and the case in the above section, the code implement the same way for both cases to change the standby’s LACP system ID. Otherwise the standby can keep the current system ID.
- If the standby is down, no action is taken by ICCP in master. In this scenario, the CE device brings down the links to the standby. The result is all data traffic from CE are sent to the master.
- If the peer device comes up online, peer connection will be established again, information will be sync’ed up between ICCP peers.

## 7.4. Peer link down

![Diagram 7.4](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_7.4.png)
Diagram 7.4

- In this scenario, peers may be directly connected, or use other tools such as BFD to detect the status of peer-link(Not supported currently).
- If peer link and peer keepalive link is the same link, peer link down may cause peer connection down. In the case when keepalive connection is down, please see the above section. User should not design the network in this way.
- When peer link is down, as shown above, all the MACs that point to the peer-link will be removed in both peers. Data forwarding for CE continues as usual. If ICCP connection uses this peer link interface, the action is the same as described in "peer connection down". If ICCP connection doesn’t use this peer link interface, this is not a split-brain scenario because the state can still be synchronized by keepalive link. If one MC-LAG enabled port is down, data traffic may get lost since the peer link as a backup path is down.

## 7.5. Peer link is Vxlan tunnel

- The peer link can be Vxlan tunnel. This scenario is test in progress, it will be supported in next release.

# 8. SONiC system diagram for MCLAG

The MC-LAG code will run in a separate container. The following chart is with added ICCPd container. The blocks below are just for  illustrating the concept flow.

Note: ICCPd docker container doesn't start by default, it could be started on demand. Linux command `sudo systemctl start iccpd` can be used to start ICCPd docker container, `sudo systemctl enable iccpd` will start ICCPd docker automatic after rebooting.

![Diagram 8](https://github.com/shine4chen/SONiC/blob/mclag/images/mclag_hld/MCLAG_HLD_8.png)
Diagram 8

Flow 1: ICCPd reads MCLAG related configuration from CONFIG_DB

Flow 2: Updating kernel with ARP learned. Syncing up kernel with changed MAC to update LACP with system ID for the portchannel.

Flow 3: ICCPd learns events such as L2 interface creation, L3 interface creation, MAC of local interfaces and its modification, IP address and its modification, ARP learning, VLAN creation and its member’s association/de-association, interface admin/link state.

Flow 4: ICCPd update teamd with system ID to help LACP to form the portchannel for the MLAG ports. Please note teamds in the two peers are running independently.

Flow 5: mclagctld receives CLIs, pass it on to ICCPd, MC-LAG information is returned by ICCPd so that it can be displayed.

Flow 6: ICCPd exchanges information with APP_DB via mclagsyncd, for example, the information to stop L2 learning on peer-link, flush software FDB table of MC-LAG vlans、isolate peer link from port-channel in the flood domain, associate MAC to its L3 interface.

Flow 7: same as step 6.

Flow 8: After configure/update APP_DB, OrchAgent monitors and procesess the related information, then update ASIC_DB.

# 9. Design changes

## 9.1. The schema changes

### 9.1.1. Add MCLAG configuration

```jason
  "MC_LAG": {
            "{{MC-LAG_domain_id}}": {
              "local_ip": {{ipv4_address}},
              "peer_link": {{interface_name}},
              "peer_ip": {{ipv4_address}},,
              "mclag_interface": {{interface_name}}
          }
      },

  MC-LAG domain ID, must be from 1 to 65535.
  "local_ip" is the ip address of this device to set TCP connection.
  "peer_ip" is the ip address of peer device to set TCP connection.
  "peer_link" is the name of interface that act as interconnection.
  "mclag_interface" is the name of PortChannel interfaces that MC-LAG enabled, can be multiple interfaces separated by commas ‘,’.
  The example configuration is:

  "MC_LAG": {
        "1": {
            "local_ip": "2.2.2.1",
            "mclag_interface": "PortChannel0001,PortChannel0002",
            "peer_link": "PortChannel0022",
            "peer_ip": "2.2.2.2"
        }
    },
```

### 9.1.2. Add Acl_table and Acl_rule_table in app-db

Jason definition is exactly the same as acl_table and acl_rule_table in config-db. MCLAG uses acl to isolate peer-link from mclag-enabled port-channel. so We add acl_table and acl_rule_table in app-db. Other apps which need to configure acl dynamically can reuse this mechanism.

The acl hld has defined app_acl_table and app_acl_rule_table but did not implement it. Please refer [acl_hld](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/blob/master/doc/acl/ACL-High-Level-Design.md#31211-acl-tables-table) for detail.

```jason
    "ACL_TABLE": {
        "mclag": {
            "policy_desc" : "Mclag egress port isolate acl",
            "type" : "MCLAG",
            "ports" : [
                "PortChannel0100"
                ]
        }
    },
    "ACL_RULE": {
       "mclag|mclag": {
            "OUT_PORTS" : "Ethernet2,Ethernet1,Ethernet0",
            "IP_TYPE" : "ANY",
            "PACKET_ACTION" : "DROP"
        }
    }
```

## 9.2. Add mclagsyncd process

Mclagsyncd will work with APP_DB to take care of following actions:

- Disable L2 MAC learning for peer-link ports.
- Flush FDB table contents before disable L2 MAC learning.
- Updating MAC association with its L3 interface. For example, PortChannel0001 is configured with ip address, it is L3 interface. When changing the MAC of L2 port PortChannel0001, the MAC of L3 interface must be changed to the same MAC at the same time. If not, data forwarding is blocked via L3 interface.
- When the MC-LAG enabled port-channel is down, update the nexthop of MAC entries learned from this PortChannel to point to peer link.
- Isolate peer-link from MC-LAG enabled port-channel.

Mclagsyncd will work with ASIC_DB to take care of following actions:
- Read MACs from ASIC_DB, and notify the MAC changes to ICCPd. FDB entries learned from MC-LAG enabled port-channel will be synced up with peer.

## 9.3. CLI design

Add mclagctld process to support new defined CLIs so that the ICCPd related information can be displayed.

The new CLIs are:

- `mclagdctl -i <mclag-id> dump arp`

    Display the local ARP entries learned from the port-channels that mclag is enabled.

```shell

admin@sonic:~$ mclagdctl -i 100 dump arp
No.   IP                  MAC               DEV
1     10.1.1.1    00:1B:21:BA:DF:A8   PortChannel0001

```

- `mclagdctl -i <mclag-id> dump mac`

    Display the local MAC entries.

```shell

admin@sonic:~$ mclagdctl -i 100 dump mac
TYPE: S-STATIC, D-DYNAMIC; AGE: L-Local age, P-Peer age
No. TYPE MAC               VID  DEV        ORIGIN-DEV         AGE
1   D    00:1B:21:BA:DF:A8 1000 Ethernet4  PortChannel0001     L
2   D    00:1B:21:BB:2F:DC 1000 Ethernet4  PortChannel0002     L
TYPE: The MAC type, 'S' indicates STATIC, 'D' indicates DYNAMIC.
DEV: The port that this MAC is set currently.
ORIGIN-DEV: The origin port that this MAC is learned. In this sample, MAC 00:1B:21:BA:DF:A8 is learned from PortChannel0001. When PortChannel0001 is down, this MAC is reroute to Ethernet4.
AGE: The age flag of this MAC. 'L' flag indicates this MAC in local switch is aged, 'P' flag indicates this MAC in peer switch is aged. When both of 'L' and 'P' flags are set, this MAC is deleted.

```

- `mclagdctl -i <mclag-id> dump portlist local`

    Display the local port-list, include the port-channels and their member ports.

```shell

admin@sonic:~$ mclagdctl -i 100 dump portlist local
------------------------------------------------------------
Ifindex: 7
Type: PortChannel
PortName: PortChannel0002
MAC: 6c:ec:5a:08:31:49
IPv4Address: 2.2.2.1
Prefixlen: 24
State: Down
IsL3Interface: Yes
IsPeerlink: No
MemberPorts: Ethernet10
IsIsolateWithPeerlink: No
VlanList: Vlan10
------------------------------------------------------------
IsL3Interface: If one interface is configured one ip address, this interface is called L3 interface.
IsPeerlink: 'Yes' indicates this port is configured as peer-link port.
MemberPorts: The member ports in one PortChannel.
IsIsolateWithPeerlink: 'Yes' indicates this port is isolated with peer-link port. If the MCLAG enabled PortChannel is up, it is isolated with peer-link port.
VlanList: The vlan list that this port is joined.

```

- `mclagdctl -i <mclag-id> dump portlist peer`

    Display the peer portlist, include the port-channels that mclag enabled.

```shell

admin@sonic:~$ mclagdctl -i 100 dump portlist peer
------------------------------------------------------------
Ifindex: 1
Type: PortChannel
PortName: PortChannel0001
MAC: 6c:ec:5a:08:31:49
State: Up
------------------------------------------------------------

```

- `mclagdctl -i <mclag-id> dump state`

    Display the local configuration and state.

```shell

admin@sonic:~$ mclagdctl dump state –i 100
The MCLAG's keepalive is: OK
Domain id: 100
Local Ip: 10.100.1.1
Peer Ip: 10.100.1.2
Peer Link Interface: Ethernet4
Peer Link Mac: 6c:ec:5a:08:31:94
Role: Active
MCLAG Interface: PortChannel0002,PortChannel0001
Loglevel: debug

The MCLAG's keepalive is: 'OK' indicates the peer connection is established.
Role: System compares local ip and peer ip to determine the role of the switch, the one with large IP address is the standby, and the lower is active.
MCLAG Interface: The name of PortChannel interfaces that MCLAG enabled.
Loglevel: The current log level of MCLAG.

```
- `mclagdctl config loglevel -l <level>`

    Set the log level of MCLAG. Log level can be critical, err, warn, notice, info and debug, default is notice.

```shell

admin@sonic:~$ mclagdctl config loglevel -l err
Config loglevel success!

```

## 9.4. aclorch changes

Adding the following logic:([PR#810](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/pull/810))

- ACL table can be matched with OUT_PORTS.
- Aclorch as the consumer to monitor the events of APP_ACL_TABLE_NAME and APP_ACL_RULE_TABLE_NAME tables in APP_DB . The definition of APP_ACL_TABLE_NAME and APP_ACL_RULE_TABLE_NAME are in sonic-swss-common/common/schema.h.
- ICCPd set ACL rule in APP_DB for port isolation.

## 9.5. portmgr changes

Adding the following logics:

- If the port has the attribute ‘learn_mode’ in CFG_DB, read the attribute and set this attribute in APP_DB. If ‘learn_mode’ is set to ‘disabled’, the MAC learning of this port is disbled.

## 9.6. portsorch changes

Adding the following logics:

- Listening new APP_DB events, enable or disable to learn interface MACs. If ‘learn_mode’ attribute of one port is set to ‘disabled’, the MAC learning of this port is disbled.([PR#809](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/pull/809))
- Add LAG name map to counter table, so that ‘show mac’ can display the MACs learned from LAG ports. ([PR#808](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/pull/808))

## 9.7. intfmgr changes

Adding the following logics:

- If the L3 interface has the attribute ‘mac_addr’ in CFG_DB, read the attribute and set this attribute in APP_DB. Attribute ‘mac_addr’ specify the MAC of this L3 interface.

## 9.8. intfsorch changes

Adding the following logics:

- Listening MAC modification of L3 interfaces,  updating it to ASIC.([PR#814](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/pull/814))
- Removing the function of adding/delete direct connected network FIB update triggered by creation of L3 interface in orchAgent. (Such direct connected network FIB does not respond to the state change, which is wrong, it only responds to the ip address addition or deletion）[PR#878](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/pull/878))

## 9.9. routeorch changes

Adding the following logics:

- For the creation of the directly connected network, the code is moved from intfsorch to routeorch. Like other types of route, the direct connect network is informed by Zebra. This is to fix a common issue, not only for MC-LAG support.([PR#878](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/pull/878))

## 9.10. fdborch changes

Adding the following logics:

- If the FDB entry is already exist when the event is ADD, remove the entry first, then add the entry.
- FDB MAC can be learnt from or set to VXLAN tunnel in ASIC.
([PR#877](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss/pull/877))

## 9.11. vxlanmgr changes

Adding the following logics:

- When create Vxlan tunnel map (encap and decap) , create the L2 interface in Linux kernel at the same time. The format of L2 interface name is ‘VxlanTunnelName-VNI’, such as VTTNL0001-1000. The prefix of Vxlan tunnel name in CFG_DB must be 'VTTNL'.

## 9.12. vxlanorch changes

Adding the following logics:

- When creating vxlan tunnel, create its bridge port.
- Add tunnel name map to counter table, so that ‘show mac’ can display the MACs learned from Vxlan tunnel.
- Listening new APP_DB events，enable or disable to learn VXLAN tunnel interface MACs. If ‘learn_mode’ is set to ‘disabled’, the MAC learning of this vxlan tunnel is disabled.

## 9.13. vnetorch changes

- Vnetorch create the bridge port of Vxlan tunnel in function VNetBitmapObject::getBridgeInfoByVni(), this is not the best place to create bridge port. In vxlanorch, when creating Vxlan tunnel, create its bridge port at the same time.

## 9.14. warm-reboot consideration

- Teamd saves the last LACP PDU received from LAG peer in one file per port in directory '/var/warmboot/teamd/'. During warm-reboot, the routes or MACs in ASIC are not changed.
- In MC-LAG scenario, two peer devices form one end point of a LAG, these two devices must have the same MAC address since it’s used for LACP. During warm-reboot, this MAC must not be changed. For this reason, if the last reboot is warm-reboot, when creating new portchannel, before the first LACP PDU is sent out via those newly added ports, teamd gets the MAC from the saved LACP PDU and updates the port MAC accordingly.
- During warm-reboot, a USR1 signal is sent to ICCP. Then ICCP send a message to the peer to notify that this device will be warm-rebooted.
- During warm-reboot, ICCP is also rebooted. During ICCP warm-reboot, ICCP doesn’t change any forwarding entry in ASIC such as route or MAC, so the data forwarding continues as usual in the rebooting device.
- During warm-reboot, the peer connection may be lost because of the keepalive timeout. In this scenario, during a defined time window, the remote peer doesn’t change any forwarding entry in ASIC such as route or MAC, so the data forwarding continues as usual.
- During warm-reboot, MAC does not age.

## 9.15. teammgr changes

Adding the following logics:

- If the PortChannel has the attribute 'learn_mode' in CFG_DB, read the attribute and set this attribute in APP_DB. If 'learn_mode' is set to 'disabled', the MAC learning of LAG port is disbled.
- When warm-reboot teammgr gets MAC from saved LACP PDU and update port-channel's MAC before port-channel member port sending any LACP PDU.

# 10. Test
