## Scope

This document describes how to leverage the SONiC config DB to add or remove BGP aggregate address and the SONiC state DB to track the state of it with BBR awareness


## Overview
In BGP, we can aggregate contributing routes into one single aggregated route. It has many advantages, for example reducing routes’ count.

However, firstly, SONiC can’t configurate aggregated addresses via config DB and doesn’t have CLI support for it.

Secondly, if we aggregated routes without BBR feature on device, we many got packet drop on this device due to contributing routes missing.

To leverage the benefit of address aggregation and the BBR feature, we are trying to design the aggregate address configuration mechanism with BBR awareness in this doc.


## Requirements
With this design, users can add or remove aggregated address via editing config DB or config CLI with parameters to control the aggregation and route announcement behavior and can use the show command to check aggregated address on device.

With BBR awareness, aggregated address will be generated conditionally depend on BBR feature's state.

## High Level Design
First we introduce the config DB extension which define the feature scope and parameters we have.
Then we introduce how the bgp container will change its behavior accordingly.

### Config DB Extension
We define a new YANG model to add a new key named `BGP_AGGREGATE_ADDRESS` in config DB.
The key will index to a list of aggregated addresses with their parameters.

The YANG model and config DB demo are showed in below:

#### Yang Model
```
module sonic-bgp-aggregate-address {

    namespace "http://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-bgp-aggregate-address";

    prefix bgp-aggregate-address;

    yang-version 1.1;

    import ietf-inet-types {
        prefix inet;
    }

    container sonic-bgp-aggregate-address {
        container BGP_AGGREGATE_ADDRESS {

            description "BGP_AGGREGATE_ADDRESS part of config_db.json";

            list BGP_AGGREGATE_ADDRESS_LIST {

                description "BGP_AGGREGATE_ADDRESS list part of config_db.json";

                key "aggregate-address";

                leaf aggregate-address {
                    type inet:ip-prefix;
                    description "Aggregate address to be advertised";
                }

                leaf bbr-required {
                    type boolean {
                        pattern "true|false";
                    }
                    default false;
                    description "Set if BBR is required for generating aggregate address";
                }

                leaf summary-only {
                    type boolean {
                        pattern "true|false";
                    }
                    default false;
                    description "Only advertise the summary of aggregate address";
                }

                leaf as-set {
                    type boolean {
                        pattern "true|false";
                    }
                    default false;
                    description "Set if include the AS set when advertising the aggregated address";
                }

                leaf aggregate-address-prefix-list {
                    type string {
                        pattern "[0-9a-zA-Z_-]*";
                        length 0..128;
                    }
                    default "";
                    description "Set if include the AS set when advertising the aggregated address";
                }

                leaf contributing-address-prefix-list {
                    type string {
                        pattern "[0-9a-zA-Z_-]*";
                        length 0..128;
                    }
                    default "";
                    description "Set if include the AS set when advertising the aggregated address";
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Config DB Sample
```json
{
    ...
    "BGP_AGGREGATE_ADDRESS": {
        "192.168.0.0/24": {
            "bbr-required": "true",
            "summary-only": "false",
            "aggregate-address-prefix-list": "AGG_ROUTES_V4",
            "contributing-address-prefix-list": "AGG_CONTRIBUTING_ROUTES_V4"
        },
        "fc00::/63": {
            "bbr-required": "true",
            "summary-only": "true",
            "as-set": "true"
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

#### Parameters
We have parameters to control the behavior of aggregate address in bgp container.

##### BBR Required
It's a boolean to indicate whether only generate aggregated address when BBR feature is enabled.

If it's true and the BBR feature is not enabled, aggregated address won't generated.

##### Summary Only
It's a boolean to indicate whether only advertise aggregate address only.

If it's true, then contributing routes will be suppressed and only aggregated address will be advertised.

##### AS Set
It's a boolean to indicate whether add a as set of contributing routes in as path when advertising aggregated address.

If it's true, then when advertising aggregated address there will be a as set of contributing routes appended at as path.

##### Aggregate Address Prefix List
It's a string which should be the name of a prefix list, and the aggregate address will be append to the prefix list.

##### Contributing Address Prefix List
It's a string which should be the name of a prefix list, and the aggregate address will be append to the prefix list with prefix length filter to filter prefixes whose length greater or equal to the prefix length of the aggregate address.

### State DB Extension
For every aggregated address, we track its state in state DB, it has two states active and inactive. Active state means the address is configurated in the bgp container, while inactive state means isn't.

#### State DB sample:
```json
{
    ...
    "BGP_AGGREGATE_ADDRESS": {
        "192.168.0.0/24": {
            "state": "inactive",
            "aggregate-address-prefix-list": "AGG_ROUTES_V4",
            "contributing-address-prefix-list": "AGG_CONTRIBUTING_ROUTES_V4"
        },
        "fc00::/63": {
            "state": "active",
            "aggregate-address-prefix-list": "",
            "contributing-address-prefix-list": ""
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

### Bgp Container Behavior
The process bgpcfgd in bgp container will subscribe the keys `BGP_AGGREGATE_ADDRESS` and `BGP_BBR` in config DB. The possible events and related process are:
1. Add address in config DB:
    - if BRR requirement is satisfied, generate aggregated address in the bgp container and add address in state DB with active state and prefix list names.
        - if aggregate-address-prefix-list provided, append aggregated address to the prefix list.
        - if contributing-address-prefix-list provided, append aggregated address to the prefix list with prefix length filter.
    - else, add address in state DB with inactive state and prefix list names.
2. Remove address in config DB:
    - Query state DB to see if there are prefix lists contain the address, if yes, remove the address from those prefix lists.
    - Remove aggregated address in the bgp container and remove address in state DB.
3. Enable BBR feature in config DB:
    - In config DB, find out all addresses that has bbr-required equals true and generate aggregated addresses in the bgp container then update state DB with active state.
        - if aggregate-address-prefix-list is not empty string, append aggregated address to the prefix list.
        - if contributing-address-prefix-list is not empty string, append aggregated address to the prefix list with prefix length filter.
4. Disable BBR feature in config DB:
    - In config DB, find out all addresses that has bbr-required equals true and remove aggregated addresses in the bgp container then update state DB with inactive state.
        - if aggregate-address-prefix-list is not empty string, remove aggregated address from the prefix list.
        - if contributing-address-prefix-list is not empty string, remove aggregated address from the prefix list.
5. The bgp container restarted or start up:
    - The bgp container will remove all the addresses in state DB before processing any address in config DB.
6. Update parameter of address in config DB:
    - First remove the address according to the behavior 2.
    - Then add the address according to the behavior 1.

  config bgp aggregate-address remove fc00:1::/64
  ```

### Test Plan Design
First we will implement unit test in sonic-buildimage repo to test basic functionality.

Then we will implement test in sonic-mgmt repo to test if this feature works including but not limited to scenarios like:
1. Add aggregated address with bbr-required equals true and check whether the address will be generated when switch the state of BBR feature.
2. Add aggregated address with bbr-required equals false and check whether the address will be generated when switch the state of BBR feature.
3. Remove aggregated address in config db and check whether the address will be removed from state db and bgp container.
4. More tests details will be published in sonic-mgmt repo.
